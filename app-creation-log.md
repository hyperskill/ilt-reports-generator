## 2025-10-06: Refactor - Overall Engagement vs Weekly Momentum

### Breaking Change: Removed Weekly Momentum Calculation
**Rationale**: Student reports are for evaluating overall course results, not recent trends. Weekly momentum (last 7 vs previous 7 days) is not relevant for summative assessment at course completion.

### Changes
**Type System**:
- Replaced `StudentMomentum` with `StudentEngagement`
- `StudentEngagement` includes: level (High/Medium/Low), description, active_days_ratio

**Processor Logic** (`student-report-processor.ts`):
- Removed `calculateMomentum()` function
- Added `calculateEngagement()` function based on entire course period
- Engagement = average of (active_days_ratio + consistency from dynamic analysis)
- High: ‚â•60%, Medium: 30-60%, Low: <30%

**Signal Extraction**:
- Removed momentum-based focus signals: `momentum_down`, `end_dropoff` (with momentum condition)
- Added overall pattern signals: `high_burstiness` (>0.8), `early_dropoff` (without momentum)
- Updated `extractFocus()` to remove `series` parameter (no longer needed)

**Highlights Generation**:
- Updated text to emphasize overall course patterns
- "Overall engagement" instead of "recent activity"
- "Throughout the course" instead of "this week"
- "Pattern shows" instead of "activity dipped"

**Next Steps Generation**:
- Removed momentum-based suggestions ("Plan two short sessions this week")
- Added engagement-based suggestions ("Establish regular study schedule")
- Added burstiness-based suggestions ("Create more regular study rhythm")
- Suggestions now focus on overall habits, not weekly fixes

**UI Changes** (`app/student/[userId]/page.tsx`):
- Replaced "Recent Activity" card with "Overall Engagement" card
- Emoji indicators: üî• High, üìä Medium, üí§ Low (was üìàüìâ‚û°Ô∏è)
- Description shows total active days across full period
- Removed `getMomentumColor()`, added `getEngagementColor()`

### Benefits
1. **More relevant**: Summative assessment vs formative feedback
2. **Clearer insights**: Overall learning patterns vs weekly fluctuations
3. **Better actionable advice**: Long-term habits vs short-term fixes
4. **Consistent purpose**: Report evaluates course completion, not ongoing progress

### Algorithm Alignment
Modified from Personal Student Report Algorithm v1:
- Kept: ¬ß3 (Wins & Focus), ¬ß5 (Topic selection), ¬ß6 (Next steps structure), ¬ß7 (Curve explanation)
- Removed: ¬ß4 (Momentum last 7 vs previous 7)
- Added: Overall engagement calculation (active days ratio + consistency)

## 2025-10-06: Personalized Student Report Feature

### Major Feature: Individual Student Detail Pages
- Implemented comprehensive student detail pages accessible via clickable names in results tables
- Based on **Personal Student Report Algorithm v1** specification
- Full integration with existing Performance v3 and Dynamic/Easing v3 pipelines

### New Type Definitions
Added to `lib/types.ts`:
- `StudentTopic`: Topic-level analysis with labels (Comfortable/Watch/Attention)
- `StudentMomentum`: Weekly momentum tracking (Up/Flat/Down/Unknown)
- `StudentHighlight`: Wins and focus areas for student
- `StudentReport`: Complete personal report structure with all signals

### New Processor: student-report-processor.ts
**Core Functions**:
1. `generateStudentReport()`: Main entry point, orchestrates all signal extraction
2. `generateTopicTable()`: Synthesizes topics from step-level submissions data
3. `extractWins()`: Identifies positive signals (achievement, consistency, steady work, early progress)
4. `extractFocus()`: Identifies attention areas (struggling topics, low consistency, momentum down, easing risks)
5. `calculateMomentum()`: Computes last 7 days vs previous 7 days trend
6. `generateHighlights()`: Creates 3-5 plain-English bullets (wins first, then focus)
7. `generateNextSteps()`: Produces 2-3 actionable suggestions prioritized by impact

**Topic Analysis**:
- Groups steps into synthetic topics (every 10 steps = 1 topic)
- Calculates per-topic metrics: attempts/step, first-pass rate, deltas from course average
- Assigns labels: Comfortable (doing well) / Watch (needs attention) / Attention (requires review)
- Computes topic_score for prioritization (higher = more attention needed)

**Signal Extraction Logic**:
- **Wins** (candidates):
  - High score (‚â•80%) or success rate (‚â•85%)
  - Strong consistency (‚â•0.5)
  - Low burstiness (‚â§0.6) - steady work pattern
  - Positive frontload index (‚â•0.10) - early progress
  - Comfortable topics with high first-pass rate (‚â•0.7)
  
- **Focus** (candidates):
  - Topics labeled Watch/Attention
  - High struggle index (‚â•0.6)
  - Low active days ratio (<0.3)
  - Momentum down (‚â•15% decrease)
  - Easing risks: ease-in with late start (t25 > 0.4), ease-out with dropoff (t75 < 0.6)

**Momentum Calculation**:
- Requires ‚â•14 days of data
- Compares last 7 days total activity vs previous 7 days
- Delta ‚â• +15% = Up, ‚â§ -15% = Down, else Flat

**Next Steps Generator**:
Priority order:
1. Focus on #1 attention topic (if exists)
2. Plan short sessions if momentum down
3. Join webinar if attendance < 40%
4. Maintain rhythm / build consistency (fallback)

### New Route: /student/[userId]/page.tsx
**Student Detail Page Components**:
1. **Header Card**: Name, user ID, segment badge, easing badge, key scores
2. **Highlights Section**: 3-5 actionable bullets with visual distinction (wins in green, focus in orange)
3. **Momentum Card**: Recent activity trend with emoji indicator and explanation
4. **Activity Curve Card**: 
   - Frontload index, consistency, burstiness metrics
   - Progress quartiles (t25/t50/t75)
   - Interactive EasingChart visualization
   - Plain-English curve explanation
5. **Topics Grid**: 
   - "Going Well" (green) - comfortable topics
   - "Focus Areas" (orange) - topics needing attention
6. **Next Steps Card**: Numbered action items (1-3 suggestions)
7. **Detailed Statistics**: Full performance metrics, meeting attendance
8. **Topic Analysis Table**: Complete breakdown with labels, deltas from average, evidence quality

**UI/UX Features**:
- All terms include hover tooltips and legend explanations
- Color-coded badges for quick visual scanning
- Delta indicators show +/- from course average
- Evidence quality warnings for low-data topics
- Responsive grid layouts
- Smooth animations on load

- Responsive container with max-width
- Smooth transitions

**Updated**: `PerformanceResults.module.css`, `DynamicResults.module.css`
- `.clickableRow`: hover effect on table rows
- `.clickableName`: styled clickable names with accent color and underline animation

### Algorithm Alignment
Fully implements **Personal Student Report Algorithm v1**:
- ‚úÖ Student-first language (plain English, no heavy statistics)
- ‚úÖ Personal signal selection (top wins + focus items)
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation (handles missing meetings, short data spans)
- ‚úÖ Transparent conclusions (all signals tied to specific metrics)
- ‚úÖ Tone guidelines: supportive, actionable, wins before focus
- ‚úÖ Edge cases: sparse data, no titles, conflicting signals

### Copy & Messaging
All student-facing text follows algorithm guidelines:
- Sentences limited to ~12-16 words
- One idea per bullet
- Supportive verbs ("review", "plan", "try") instead of negatives
- "Compared with the course" phrasing (no precise ranks)
- Wins presented first, focus paired with next steps

### Integration
- Seamlessly integrates with existing v3 pipelines
- No changes to data processing or upload flow
- Reuses existing chart components (EasingChart)
- Leverages AppContext for data access
- Zero impact on existing functionality

### English-Only Interface

# App Creation Log

## 2025-10-03: Algorithm v3 - No External Activity File Required

### Major Rewrite: Removed activity.csv Requirement
- **REMOVED activity.csv** - No longer required or supported
- All activity metrics now derived from `submissions.csv` only
- Upload flow simplified back to 3 required files (grade_book, learners, submissions) + optional meetings
- Algorithm v3 spec: builds everything from existing data sources

### Type System Updates
- Removed `activity?: CSVFile` from `UploadedFiles`
- Removed `gamma` from `DisplaySettings` (only alpha, beta remain)
- Updated `PerformanceRow`:
  - Removed: `active_minutes_total`, `sessions_count`
  - Added: `active_days`, `correct_submissions` (explicit field)

  - Removed: `activity_minutes` (third source)
  - Kept: `activity_platform`, `activity_meetings` (two sources only)

### Processing Logic - Complete Rewrite

#### Dynamic Processor (v3)
**Activity Derivation from Submissions**:
```
Platform Activity = Œ£(correct: 1.0, incorrect: 0.25) per day
Composite Activity = Œ± * Platform + Œ≤ * Meetings
```
- Weights submissions by status: correct=1.0, incorrect=0.25
- Two-source blending only: platform + meetings (no third source)
- Default weights: Œ±=1.0, Œ≤=1.5
- **New metrics**:
  - `consistency`: #days with activity / span_days
  - `burstiness`: std(activity) / mean(activity)

#### Performance Processor (v3)
**Activity Signals from Submissions**:
- `active_days`: n_distinct(date from timestamps)
- `active_days_ratio`: active_days / span_days
- `effort_index`: z-score(submissions) ‚äï z-score(active_days)
- `consistency_index`: same as active_days_ratio
- `struggle_index`: computed from persistence + success_rate signals

**Updated Segmentation Rules** (v3 spec):
1. Leader engaged: total_pct ‚â• 80 AND meetings ‚â• 70%
2. Leader efficient: total_pct ‚â• 80 AND persistence ‚â§ 3 AND consistency ‚â• 0.5
3. Balanced + engaged: 30-80% AND meetings ‚â• 60% AND consistency ‚â• 0.4
4. Hardworking but struggling: effort ‚â• 0.5 AND struggle ‚â• 0.6
5. Low engagement: (total < 30 AND submissions < 20) OR (effort ‚â§ -0.5 AND consistency < 0.3)
6. Balanced middle: else
