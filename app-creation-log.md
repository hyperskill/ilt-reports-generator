**`shared_reports` table**:
- Stores shareable report versions with editable blocks
- Fields:
  - `report_type`: 'manager' or 'student'
  - `source_report_id`: Reference to original report
  - `user_id`: For student reports, identifies which student
  - `title`, `description`: Metadata
  - `blocks`: JSONB array of content blocks with order
  - `is_public`: Public/private toggle
  - `access_code`: Optional link-based sharing code
  - Audit fields: `created_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

## 2025-10-06: Refactor - Overall Engagement vs Weekly Momentum

### Breaking Change: Removed Weekly Momentum Calculation
**Rationale**: Student reports are for evaluating overall course results, not recent trends. Weekly momentum (last 7 vs previous 7 days) is not relevant for summative assessment at course completion.

### Changes
**Type System**:
- Replaced `StudentMomentum` with `StudentEngagement`
- `StudentEngagement` includes: level (High/Medium/Low), description, active_days_ratio

**Processor Logic** (`student-report-processor.ts`):
- Removed `calculateMomentum()` function
- Added `calculateEngagement()` function based on entire course period
- Engagement = average of (active_days_ratio + consistency from dynamic analysis)
- High: ≥60%, Medium: 30-60%, Low: <30%

**Signal Extraction**:
- Removed momentum-based focus signals: `momentum_down`, `end_dropoff` (with momentum condition)
- Added overall pattern signals: `high_burstiness` (>0.8), `early_dropoff` (without momentum)
- Updated `extractFocus()` to remove `series` parameter (no longer needed)

**Highlights Generation**:
- Updated text to emphasize overall course patterns
- "Overall engagement" instead of "recent activity"
- "Throughout the course" instead of "this week"
- "Pattern shows" instead of "activity dipped"

**Next Steps Generation**:
- Removed momentum-based suggestions ("Plan two short sessions this week")
- Added engagement-based suggestions ("Establish regular study schedule")
- Added burstiness-based suggestions ("Create more regular study rhythm")
- Suggestions now focus on overall habits, not weekly fixes

**UI Changes** (`app/student/[userId]/page.tsx`):
- Replaced "Recent Activity" card with "Overall Engagement" card
- Emoji indicators: 🔥 High, 📊 Medium, 💤 Low (was 📈📉➡️)
- Description shows total active days across full period
- Removed `getMomentumColor()`, added `getEngagementColor()`

### Benefits
1. **More relevant**: Summative assessment vs formative feedback
2. **Clearer insights**: Overall learning patterns vs weekly fluctuations
3. **Better actionable advice**: Long-term habits vs short-term fixes
4. **Consistent purpose**: Report evaluates course completion, not ongoing progress

### Algorithm Alignment
Modified from Personal Student Report Algorithm v1:
- Kept: §3 (Wins & Focus), §5 (Topic selection), §6 (Next steps structure), §7 (Curve explanation)
- Removed: §4 (Momentum last 7 vs previous 7)
- Added: Overall engagement calculation (active days ratio + consistency)

---

## 2025-10-06: Personalized Student Report Feature

### Major Feature: Individual Student Detail Pages
- Implemented comprehensive student detail pages accessible via clickable names in results tables
- Based on **Personal Student Report Algorithm v1** specification
- Full integration with existing Performance v3 and Dynamic/Easing v3 pipelines

### New Type Definitions
Added to `lib/types.ts`:
- `StudentTopic`: Topic-level analysis with labels (Comfortable/Watch/Attention)
- `StudentMomentum`: Weekly momentum tracking (Up/Flat/Down/Unknown)
- `StudentHighlight`: Wins and focus areas for student
- `StudentReport`: Complete personal report structure with all signals

### New Processor: student-report-processor.ts
**Core Functions**:
1. `generateStudentReport()`: Main entry point, orchestrates all signal extraction
2. `generateTopicTable()`: Synthesizes topics from step-level submissions data
3. `extractWins()`: Identifies positive signals (achievement, consistency, steady work, early progress)
4. `extractFocus()`: Identifies attention areas (struggling topics, low consistency, momentum down, easing risks)
5. `calculateMomentum()`: Computes last 7 days vs previous 7 days trend
6. `generateHighlights()`: Creates 3-5 plain-English bullets (wins first, then focus)
7. `generateNextSteps()`: Produces 2-3 actionable suggestions prioritized by impact

**Topic Analysis**:
- Groups steps into synthetic topics (every 10 steps = 1 topic)
- Calculates per-topic metrics: attempts/step, first-pass rate, deltas from course average
- Assigns labels: Comfortable (doing well) / Watch (needs attention) / Attention (requires review)
- Computes topic_score for prioritization (higher = more attention needed)

**Signal Extraction Logic**:
- **Wins** (candidates):
  - High score (≥80%) or success rate (≥85%)
  - Strong consistency (≥0.5)
  - Low burstiness (≤0.6) - steady work pattern
  - Positive frontload index (≥0.10) - early progress
  - Comfortable topics with high first-pass rate (≥0.7)
  
- **Focus** (candidates):
  - Topics labeled Watch/Attention
  - High struggle index (≥0.6)
  - Low active days ratio (<0.3)
  - Momentum down (≥15% decrease)
  - Easing risks: ease-in with late start (t25 > 0.4), ease-out with dropoff (t75 < 0.6)

**Momentum Calculation**:
- Requires ≥14 days of data
- Compares last 7 days total activity vs previous 7 days
- Delta ≥ +15% = Up, ≤ -15% = Down, else Flat

**Next Steps Generator**:
Priority order:
1. Focus on #1 attention topic (if exists)
2. Plan short sessions if momentum down
3. Join webinar if attendance < 40%
4. Maintain rhythm / build consistency (fallback)

### New Route: /student/[userId]/page.tsx
**Student Detail Page Components**:
1. **Header Card**: Name, user ID, segment badge, easing badge, key scores
2. **Highlights Section**: 3-5 actionable bullets with visual distinction (wins in green, focus in orange)
3. **Momentum Card**: Recent activity trend with emoji indicator and explanation
4. **Activity Curve Card**: 
   - Frontload index, consistency, burstiness metrics
   - Progress quartiles (t25/t50/t75)
   - Interactive EasingChart visualization
   - Plain-English curve explanation
5. **Topics Grid**: 
   - "Going Well" (green) - comfortable topics
   - "Focus Areas" (orange) - topics needing attention
6. **Next Steps Card**: Numbered action items (1-3 suggestions)
7. **Detailed Statistics**: Full performance metrics, meeting attendance
8. **Topic Analysis Table**: Complete breakdown with labels, deltas from average, evidence quality

**UI/UX Features**:
- All terms include hover tooltips and legend explanations
- Color-coded badges for quick visual scanning
- Delta indicators show +/- from course average
- Evidence quality warnings for low-data topics
- Responsive grid layouts
- Smooth animations on load

### Updated Result Tables
**PerformanceResults.tsx**:
- Added clickable student names (underline on hover)
- Names link to `/student/[userId]` detail page
- Row hover effect for better UX

**DynamicResults.tsx**:
- Added clickable student names (underline on hover)
- Names link to `/student/[userId]` detail page
- Retained "View curve" button for inline expansion

### Styling
**New CSS Module**: `app/student/[userId]/student.module.css`
- Fade-in animations for cards
- Responsive container with max-width
- Smooth transitions

**Updated**: `PerformanceResults.module.css`, `DynamicResults.module.css`
- `.clickableRow`: hover effect on table rows
- `.clickableName`: styled clickable names with accent color and underline animation

### Algorithm Alignment
Fully implements **Personal Student Report Algorithm v1**:
- ✅ Student-first language (plain English, no heavy statistics)
- ✅ Personal signal selection (top wins + focus items)
- ✅ Graceful degradation (handles missing meetings, short data spans)
- ✅ Transparent conclusions (all signals tied to specific metrics)
- ✅ Tone guidelines: supportive, actionable, wins before focus
- ✅ Edge cases: sparse data, no titles, conflicting signals

### Copy & Messaging
All student-facing text follows algorithm guidelines:
- Sentences limited to ~12-16 words
- One idea per bullet
- Supportive verbs ("review", "plan", "try") instead of negatives
- "Compared with the course" phrasing (no precise ranks)
- Wins presented first, focus paired with next steps

### Integration
- Seamlessly integrates with existing v3 pipelines
- No changes to data processing or upload flow
- Reuses existing chart components (EasingChart)
- Leverages AppContext for data access
- Zero impact on existing functionality

### English-Only Interface
- All UI text, legends, tooltips in English
- Metric names use standard terminology
- Explanations accessible to non-technical users
- Consistent with overall app localization

# App Creation Log

## 2025-10-03: Algorithm v3 - No External Activity File Required

### Major Rewrite: Removed activity.csv Requirement
- **REMOVED activity.csv** - No longer required or supported
- All activity metrics now derived from `submissions.csv` only
- Upload flow simplified back to 3 required files (grade_book, learners, submissions) + optional meetings
- Algorithm v3 spec: builds everything from existing data sources

### Type System Updates
- Removed `activity?: CSVFile` from `UploadedFiles`
- Removed `gamma` from `DisplaySettings` (only alpha, beta remain)
- Updated `PerformanceRow`:
  - Removed: `active_minutes_total`, `sessions_count`
  - Added: `active_days`, `correct_submissions` (explicit field)
  - Kept: `active_days_ratio`, `effort_index`, `consistency_index`, `struggle_index`
- Updated `DynamicSummaryRow`:
  - Added: `consistency`, `burstiness`
  - Kept: all Bezier parameters, frontload_index, easing_label
- Updated `DynamicSeriesRow`:
  - Removed: `activity_minutes` (third source)
  - Kept: `activity_platform`, `activity_meetings` (two sources only)

### Processing Logic - Complete Rewrite

#### Dynamic Processor (v3)
**Activity Derivation from Submissions**:
```
Platform Activity = Σ(correct: 1.0, incorrect: 0.25) per day
Composite Activity = α * Platform + β * Meetings
```
- Weights submissions by status: correct=1.0, incorrect=0.25
- Two-source blending only: platform + meetings (no third source)
- Default weights: α=1.0, β=1.5
- **New metrics**:
  - `consistency`: #days with activity / span_days
  - `burstiness`: std(activity) / mean(activity)

#### Performance Processor (v3)
**Activity Signals from Submissions**:
- `active_days`: n_distinct(date from timestamps)
- `active_days_ratio`: active_days / span_days
- `effort_index`: z-score(submissions) ⊕ z-score(active_days)
- `consistency_index`: same as active_days_ratio
- `struggle_index`: computed from persistence + success_rate signals

**Updated Segmentation Rules** (v3 spec):
1. Leader engaged: total_pct ≥ 80 AND meetings ≥ 70%
2. Leader efficient: total_pct ≥ 80 AND persistence ≤ 3 AND consistency ≥ 0.5
3. Balanced + engaged: 30-80% AND meetings ≥ 60% AND consistency ≥ 0.4
4. Hardworking but struggling: effort ≥ 0.5 AND struggle ≥ 0.6
5. Low engagement: (total < 30 AND submissions < 20) OR (effort ≤ -0.5 AND consistency < 0.3)
6. Balanced middle: else

### UI Updates
- Upload page: removed Activity tile (back to 4 tiles: 3 required + 1 optional)

- **New required file**: `activity.csv` with fields: `user_id`, `timestamp`, `active_minutes`, `sessions` (optional)
- Updated upload flow to include 5 files (was 4)
- Activity data now drives both performance and dynamic segmentation algorithms

### Type System Updates
- Added `activity?: CSVFile` to `UploadedFiles` interface
- Extended `PerformanceRow` with activity-derived metrics:
  - `active_minutes_total`: Sum of all active minutes
  - `sessions_count`: Total sessions count
  - `active_days_ratio`: Consistency metric (active days / total days)
  - `effort_index`: Z-score normalized effort (combines minutes + sessions)
  - `consistency_index`: Same as active_days_ratio
  - `struggle_index`: Derived from low success rate + high persistence
- Extended `DynamicSeriesRow` with `activity_minutes` field (separate from platform/meetings)
- Added scaling parameters to `DisplaySettings`: `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`

### Processing Logic Enhancements

#### Dynamic Processor (`lib/processors/dynamic-processor.ts`)
- Integrated activity.csv data into daily activity aggregation
- Implemented three-source blending: `α * platform + β * meetings + γ * activity`
- Default weights: α=1.0, β=1.5, γ=0.02 (≈1 point per 50 minutes)
- Activity minutes scaled with gamma factor: `gamma * minutes + 0.2 * gamma * sessions`
- Series now exports separate components: `activity_platform`, `activity_meetings`, `activity_minutes`

#### Performance Processor (`lib/processors/performance-processor.ts`)
- Added comprehensive activity data processing
- Implemented z-score normalization for effort indices
- Calculate per-user stats: total minutes, sessions, active days, date spans
- Compute activity-derived indices:
  - **Effort index**: Normalized combination of minutes + sessions
  - **Consistency index**: Active days ratio
  - **Struggle index**: Heuristic based on success rate and persistence
- Updated segmentation rules to include activity signals:
  - High effort + struggle → "Hardworking but struggling"
  - Low effort + low consistency → "Low engagement"
  - Consistent leaders → "Leader efficient" (requires active_days_ratio >= 0.5)

### CSV Parser Updates
- Added validation for `activity.csv` file
- Required columns: `user_id` (aliases: userid, uid, user) and `timestamp` (aliases: time, date)
- Optional but recommended: `active_minutes`, `sessions`

### UI Updates
- Upload page now shows 5 tiles (added Activity tile)
- File description: "Student activity data (user_id, timestamp, active_minutes)"
- Processing page validates activity.csv presence

### Changes Made

#### 1. Type System Updates
- **lib/types.ts**: Added `structure?: CSVFile` to `UploadedFiles`
- **lib/types.ts**: Added URL components to `StudentTopic`:
  - `lesson_id?: number`
  - `first_step_id?: number`
  - `unit_id?: number`
  - `course_id?: number`

#### 2. Upload System
- **app/upload/page.tsx**: Added `structure` as optional file type
- **lib/utils/csv-parser.ts**: Added validation for structure.csv (requires `step_id`, `lesson_id`)

#### 3. Processor Updates
- **lib/processors/student-report-processor.ts**:
  - Added `structure?: any[]` to `ProcessorInput`
  - Created `structureMap` to map `step_id` → `{lesson_id, unit_id, course_id}`
  - Extended topic aggregation to include URL components
  - Each topic now stores first step's structure data

#### 4. UI Updates
- **app/student/[userId]/page.tsx**:
  - Passed `structure` data to `generateStudentReport()`
  - Made topic names in Topic Analysis table clickable links
  - URL format: `https://cogniterra.org/lesson/{lesson_id}/step/{first_step_id}?unit={unit_id}`
  - Added hover effect for better UX
  - Links open in new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

#### 5. Data Flow
1. User uploads `structure.csv` (optional) with columns: `course_id`, `module_id`, `lesson_id`, `step_id`
2. System builds map: `step_id` → URL components
3. During topic generation, each topic stores structure data from its first step
4. UI renders clickable links when structure data is available
5. Fallback: plain text when structure not provided

### User Experience
- **With structure.csv**: Topic names become clickable links to Cogniterra
- **Without structure.csv**: Topic names display as plain text
- Hover effect indicates clickable links
- External links open in new tabs

### Technical Details
- Optional file: app works without structure.csv
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Graceful fallback for missing data
- Structure data loaded once, used throughout student reports

---

## 2025-10-08: Shared Reports - Topic Links Integration

### Overview

### Changes Made

#### 1. API Updates - Shared Report Creation
- **app/api/reports/shared/create/route.ts**:
  - Added structure map building from `baseReport.structure_data`
  - Extended topic statistics to include `lesson_id`, `unit_id`, `course_id`
  - Topics now store first step's structure data for linking
  - Topic performance data includes `lesson_id` when available

#### 2. UI Updates - Block Rendering
- **app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx**:
  - Updated `TableBlockViewer` to detect topic columns with `lesson_id`
  - Added clickable links to Cogniterra for topics with structure data
  - URL format: `https://cogniterra.org/lesson/{lesson_id}/step/1`
  - Applied hover effect for better UX
  - Links open in new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

- **app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx**:
  - Updated `TableBlock` with same topic link logic
  - Links are displayed in both edit and view modes
  - Maintains consistent styling with regular student reports

### Technical Implementation
1. **Data Flow**:
   - Shared report creation fetches `structure_data` from base report
   - Structure map is built: `step_id` → `{lesson_id, unit_id, course_id}`
   - Topic aggregation includes structure data from first step
   - `lesson_id` is stored in topic performance data

2. **Rendering Logic**:
   - Table renderer checks if column is `topic` AND row has `lesson_id`
   - If both conditions met, renders clickable link
   - Otherwise, renders plain text
   - Graceful fallback when structure data not available

### User Experience
- **With structure.csv uploaded**: Topic names in student shared reports become clickable links
- **Without structure.csv**: Topics display as plain text (no errors)
- Consistent behavior with regular student reports
- Works in both edit and view modes

### Compatibility
- All existing shared reports continue to work without changes
- No breaking changes to shared report schema
- Feature works automatically if source report has structure data
- No changes needed to manager reports (they don't use topic tables)

## 2025-10-08: Shared Reports - Database Constraint Fix

### Issue
Users encountered a database error when trying to create multiple shared reports for the same student from the same source report:
```
duplicate key value violates unique constraint "shared_reports_source_report_id_user_id_report_type_key"
```

### Root Cause
The database schema had an overly restrictive unique constraint that prevented creating multiple shared reports for the same student from the same source report. This constraint was:
```sql
UNIQUE(source_report_id, user_id, report_type)
```

### Solution
**Database Schema Update:**
- **supabase/add-shared-reports.sql**: Removed the unique constraint
- **supabase/fix-shared-reports-constraint.sql**: Created migration script to drop existing constraint

**Migration Required:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE shared_reports 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS shared_reports_source_report_id_user_id_report_type_key;
```

### Impact
- ✅ Admins can now create multiple shared reports for the same student
- ✅ Different block configurations can be shared with the same student
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Better flexibility for report customization

### User Experience
- No more "duplicate key" errors when sharing reports
- Multiple shared report versions per student are now supported
- Each shared report can have different block configurations
