## 2025-10-24: Fixed Shared Reports Color System - Removed Old Badge Styles

**Agent:** Removed old hardcoded badge styles from shared report components that were overriding centralized system

**Problem**: 
- Shared reports (`/reports/shared/[id]/view`) had old `getOldBadgeStyle` function with hardcoded colors
- This function was overriding centralized color system with old RGB values and light text colors
- User reported: "на странице shared отчета цвета в чартах и бейджах не привязаны к системе управления цветами"
- Light text colors were not using the dark variant (30% brightness) from centralized system

**Solution**:
- Removed `getOldBadgeStyle` function entirely from both BlockViewer and BlockRenderer
- Removed merging of old styles: `...getOldBadgeStyle(cellValue)`
- Now using only `getBadgeStyle(cellValue)` which calls centralized system functions
- Charts were already using centralized system correctly

**Old code that was removed:**
```typescript
// This was overriding centralized colors with hardcoded values
const getOldBadgeStyle = (value: string) => {
  if (valueLower.includes('highly efficient')) {
    return {
      backgroundColor: 'rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.15)',
      color: 'rgb(21, 128, 61)', // Light green text - not dark enough
      borderColor: 'rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.4)',
    };
  }
  // ... more hardcoded colors
};

// Badge was merging both styles
style={{
  ...getBadgeStyle(cellValue),     // Centralized system
  ...getOldBadgeStyle(cellValue),  // Old styles overriding centralized
}}
```

**Files Updated**:
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx` - Removed getOldBadgeStyle, using only centralized system
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx` - Removed getOldBadgeStyle, using only centralized system
- `app-creation-log.md` - Added this entry

**Impact**:
- ✅ Shared reports now use exact same colors as rest of app
- ✅ Dark text (30% brightness) for excellent readability on all badges
- ✅ No more hardcoded color values in shared reports
- ✅ Charts and badges perfectly matched with centralized system
- ✅ Consistent color experience across view and edit modes

## 2025-10-24: Connected Students Preview Page to Centralized Color System

**Agent:** Updated students preview page to use centralized color management system

**Problem**: 
- Students preview page (`/reports/[id]/preview/students`) badges were still gray
- Used old `getSegmentColor` function with Radix UI color names
- User reported: "на этой странице бейджи все еще серые"

**Solution**:
- Imported `getPerformanceSegmentBadgeStyle` from centralized system
- Removed old `getSegmentColor` helper function
- Updated Badge components to use exact RGB colors with dark text

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: Old Radix UI color names
<Badge color={getSegmentColor(student.simple_segment)}>
  {student.simple_segment}
</Badge>

// After: Centralized system with exact RGB
<Badge style={getPerformanceSegmentBadgeStyle(student.simple_segment)}>
  {student.simple_segment}
</Badge>
```

**Files Updated**:
- `app/reports/[id]/preview/students/page.tsx` - Connected to centralized color system
- `app-creation-log.md` - Added this entry

**Impact**:
- ✅ Students table now shows colorful badges matching entire app
- ✅ Dark text for excellent readability
- ✅ Consistent colors across all preview pages (performance, dynamic, students)
- ✅ All report-related pages now unified

---

## 2025-10-24: Connected Student Page to Centralized Color System

**Agent:** Updated student detail page to use centralized color management system

**Problem**: 
- Student page badges were still using old gray/basic colors
- Not integrated with the new centralized color system
- User reported: "бейдж на странице студента все еще серый"

**Solution**:
- Imported `getPerformanceSegmentBadgeStyle` and `getEasingPatternBadgeStyle` functions
- Removed old `getSegmentColor` and `getEasingColor` helper functions
- Updated Badge components to use new style-based approach with exact RGB colors

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: Old color names
<Badge color={getSegmentColor(segment)}>
  {segment}
</Badge>

// After: Centralized color system with exact RGB
<Badge style={getPerformanceSegmentBadgeStyle(segment)}>
  {segment}
</Badge>
```

**Files Updated**:
- `app/student/[userId]/page.tsx` - Connected to centralized color system
- `app-creation-log.md` - Added this entry

**Impact**:
- ✅ Student page badges now match colors across entire app
- ✅ Dark text for excellent readability
- ✅ Consistent visual experience (performance pages, reports, student details)
- ✅ All badges now use same color generation logic

---

## 2025-10-24: Added Visual Feedback for Segment Filters

**Agent:** Implemented visual state changes for filter badges to show active/inactive status

**Problem**: 
- When clicking segment filter badges, no visual feedback was shown
- User couldn't tell which segments were filtered out
- User reported: "когда я нажимаю на эти фильтры, состояние кнопки не меняется визуально"

**Solution**:
- Added visual states to filter badges:
  - **Active** (shown in table): Full opacity (1.0), no strikethrough
  - **Inactive** (hidden from table): Reduced opacity (0.4), strikethrough text
- Applied smooth CSS transitions (0.2s) for state changes

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const isActive = selectedSegments.size === 0 || selectedSegments.has(segment);

<Badge 
  style={{ 
    opacity: isActive ? 1 : 0.4,
    textDecoration: isActive ? 'none' : 'line-through',
    transition: 'opacity 0.2s, text-decoration 0.2s',
  }}
>
  {segment}: {count}
</Badge>
```

**Files Updated**:
- `app/components/PerformanceResults.tsx` - Added visual states for performance segment filters
- `app/components/DynamicResults.tsx` - Added visual states for easing pattern filters
- `app-creation-log.md` - Added this entry

**Impact**:
- ✅ Clear visual feedback when clicking filter badges
- ✅ Users can instantly see which segments are active/hidden
- ✅ Smooth transitions for better UX
- ✅ Consistent behavior across Performance and Dynamic views

---

## 2025-10-24: Fixed Badge Text Readability - Dark Text on Light Backgrounds

**Agent:** Updated badge text color generation to use dark variants for better readability

**Problem**: 
- Light text on light badge backgrounds was hard to read
- User reported: "цвет текста на бейджах не читается" (badge text color is not readable)
- Especially problematic on light green "Balanced middle" badges

**Solution**:
- Updated `getBadgeStyleFromChartColor()` to generate dark text colors
- Multiply RGB values by 0.3 to create dark variant (30% brightness)
- Example: Light green `rgba(134, 239, 172, 0.8)` → Dark green text `rgb(40, 71, 51)`

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: Same color for text and background (poor readability)
color: `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`

// After: Dark variant for text (excellent readability)
const darkR = Math.floor(parseInt(r) * 0.3);
const darkG = Math.floor(parseInt(g) * 0.3);
const darkB = Math.floor(parseInt(b) * 0.3);
color: `rgb(${darkR}, ${darkG}, ${darkB})`
```

**Files Updated**:
- `lib/utils/segment-colors.ts` - Updated text color calculation
- `docs/COLOR_SYSTEM.md` - Updated documentation with dark text approach
- `app-creation-log.md` - Added this entry

**Impact**:
- ✅ Excellent text readability on all badge backgrounds
- ✅ Maintains color relationship with charts (same hue, darker shade)
- ✅ Works automatically for all segments and patterns
- ✅ No manual color adjustments needed

---

## 2025-10-24: Implemented Exact RGB Color Matching for Badges

**Agent:** Replaced Radix UI color names with inline RGB styles for perfect chart-badge color matching

**Problem**: 
- Radix UI predefined colors (`green`, `grass`, `lime`) couldn't provide perfect visual matching with chart RGB colors
- User reported that "green" badges for leaders and "Balanced middle" were not visually distinct enough
- Need exact RGB color matching between charts and badges

**Solution**:
- Created `getBadgeStyleFromChartColor()` function that extracts RGB values from chart colors
- Generates custom inline styles with three opacity levels:
  - Background: 15% opacity (subtle fill)
  - Text: 100% opacity (clear readability)
  - Border: 30% opacity (subtle outline)
- Enhanced with saturation/contrast filters for better visibility

**New Functions**:
- `getBadgeStyleFromChartColor(chartColor: string): React.CSSProperties`
- `getPerformanceSegmentBadgeStyle(segment: string): React.CSSProperties`
- `getEasingPatternBadgeStyle(easing: string): React.CSSProperties`

**Changes**:
- Updated all badge usage from `color={getBadgeColor()}` to `style={getBadgeStyle()}`
- Badges now use exact RGB values: `rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.8)` for leaders, `rgba(134, 239, 172, 0.8)` for balanced
- Visual distinction is now perfect - dark green vs light green is clearly visible

**Files Updated**:
- `lib/utils/segment-colors.ts` - Added badge style generation functions
- `app/components/PerformanceResults.tsx` - Updated to use badge styles
- `app/components/DynamicResults.tsx` - Updated to use badge styles
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx` - Updated to use badge styles
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx` - Updated to use badge styles
- `docs/COLOR_SYSTEM.md` - Updated documentation with new approach
- `app-creation-log.md` - Added this entry

**Before vs After**:
```typescript
// Before: Limited by Radix UI palette
<Badge color="green">Leader</Badge>
<Badge color="lime">Balanced</Badge>

// After: Exact RGB matching charts
<Badge style={getPerformanceSegmentBadgeStyle('Leader efficient')}>Leader</Badge>
<Badge style={getPerformanceSegmentBadgeStyle('Balanced middle')}>Balanced</Badge>
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Perfect color matching between charts and badges across entire app
- ✅ Clear visual distinction between similar segments (dark green vs light green)
- ✅ Consistent styling approach - all badges use same color generation logic
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for old segment names
- ✅ No dependence on Radix UI color palette limitations

---

## 2025-10-24: Updated Balanced and Linear Colors to Light Green with Lime Badge

**Agent:** Changed "Balanced middle" and "linear" colors from gray to light green, using Radix UI `lime` color for badges

**Changes**:
- Updated `BALANCED_GRAY` → `BALANCED_LIGHT_GREEN` = `rgba(134, 239, 172, 0.8)`
- Updated `LINEAR_GRAY` → `LINEAR_LIGHT_GREEN` = `rgba(134, 239, 172, 0.8)`
- Updated badge colors from `gray` → `lime` (very light green) for Balanced middle and linear
- Leader segments use `green` (dark green), creating strong visual distinction
- Added `lime`, `mint`, `cyan`, `teal` to RadixColor type for future flexibility
- All components now use the new light green color automatically via centralized system

**Color Distinction**:
- 🟢 Leaders: dark green (`green` badge + `rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.8)` chart)
- 🟢 Balanced/Linear: very light green (`lime` badge + `rgba(134, 239, 172, 0.8)` chart)

**Rationale**: 
- Light green color better represents "balanced" and "steady" performance
- Using Radix UI `lime` color creates stronger visual distinction than `grass` from leader `green`
- Lime is brighter and lighter, making it clearly distinguishable from dark green
- Charts and badges now perfectly match in color intensity

**Files Updated**:
- `lib/utils/segment-colors.ts` - Updated color constants, added multiple color options to RadixColor type
- `docs/COLOR_SYSTEM.md` - Updated documentation with lime color
- `app-creation-log.md` - Added this entry

**Impact**: 
- Strong visual distinction between leaders (dark green) and balanced segments (very light green)
- Perfect color matching between charts and badges
- Better user experience with clearly distinguishable segment types

## 2025-10-24: Centralized Color Management System

**Agent:** Implemented centralized color management system for all charts and badges

**Purpose**: Create a single source of truth for all colors used across the application, ensuring perfect consistency between charts and badges in all views (regular reports, shared reports, tables, etc.).

**Architecture**:

Created `lib/utils/segment-colors.ts` as the single source of truth containing:
- Color constants (SEGMENT_COLORS, BADGE_COLORS, MODULE_COLORS)
- Chart color functions (getPerformanceSegmentChartColor, getEasingPatternChartColor)
- Badge color functions (getPerformanceSegmentBadgeColor, getEasingPatternBadgeColor)
- Helper utilities (toSolidColor, getSegmentColorMap, getEasingColorMap)

**Color Scheme**:

1. **Performance Segments** (supports both old and new segment names):
   - 🟢 Green `rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.8)` - Leaders
     - New: "Highly efficient", "Highly engaged"
     - Old: "Leader efficient", "Leader engaged"
   - 🔴 Red `rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.8)` - Low engagement
     - New: "Low participation"
     - Old: "Low engagement"
   - 🟠 Orange `rgba(249, 115, 22, 0.8)` - Effortful
     - New: "Highly effortful"
     - Old: "Hardworking but struggling"
   - 🔵 Blue `rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.8)` - Moderate engagement
     - New: "Moderately engaged"
     - Old: "Balanced + engaged"
   - 🟢 Light Green `rgba(134, 239, 172, 0.8)` - Balanced/moderate
     - New: "Moderately performing"
     - Old: "Balanced middle"

2. **Easing Patterns**:
   - 🟢 Green `rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.8)` - "ease-out" (frontloaded)
   - 🟠 Orange `rgba(249, 115, 22, 0.8)` - "ease-in" (backloaded)
   - 🟣 Purple `rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.8)` - "ease-in-out" (S-curve)
   - 🔵 Blue `rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.8)` - "ease" (general activity)
   - 🟢 Light Green `rgba(134, 239, 172, 0.8)` - "linear" (steady)
   - 🔴 Red `rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.8)` - "no-activity"

3. **Module Activity**:
   - 🔵 Blue `rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.8)` - Completed steps
   - 🟣 Purple `rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.8)` - Meetings attended

**Files Created**:
- `lib/utils/segment-colors.ts` - Centralized color management system

**Files Updated**:
- `app/components/PerformanceResults.tsx` - Using centralized colors for charts and badges

- `app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx` - Using centralized color functions
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx` - Using centralized color functions

**Key Features**:
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All colors defined in one place
2. **Dual Output**: Functions for both chart colors (rgba) and badge colors (Radix UI color names)
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Supports both old and new segment naming conventions
4. **Semantic Colors**: Green = positive, Red = needs attention, Orange = warning, etc.
5. **Type Safety**: TypeScript types for all color functions and constants
6. **Helper Functions**: Utilities like `toSolidColor()` for border colors

**Impact**:
- ✅ Perfect consistency between charts and badges
- ✅ Charts and badges now use the same semantic colors
- ✅ Easy to maintain and update colors in the future
- ✅ Single place to change colors for entire application
- ✅ Backward compatibility with old segment names from pre-migration reports

- Created `module_tools` table
- Fields: `id`, `report_id`, `module_id`, `module_title`, `tools`, `created_by`, timestamps
- RLS policies: Admin full access, Manager read-only
- Unique constraint on `(report_id, module_id)`

**API Endpoints**:
1. **LLM Generation** (`app/api/llm/generate-module-tools/route.ts`):
   - POST endpoint for AI-generated tools information
   - Analyzes module topics and suggests relevant tools/technologies
   - **System prompt**: Base suggestions ONLY on module/topic names, no assumptions
   - Output: SHORT bullet-point list (3-7 items) with tool names only, no descriptions
   - Returns categorized tool lists (3-7 items)

2. **CRUD Operations** (`app/api/reports/module-tools/route.ts`):
   - GET: Fetch all tools for a report
   - POST: Save/update tools (upsert)
   - DELETE: Remove tools
   - Admin-only write access

**UI Implementation** (`app/components/GeneralReportSettings.tsx`):
- Added "🔧 Generate Tools" button (purple color scheme)
- Independent state management from Learning Outcomes
- Editable tools display with save/cancel
- Tools section appears below Learning Outcomes in each module

- `app/api/llm/generate-module-tools/route.ts`
- `app/api/reports/module-tools/route.ts`
- `docs/module-tools-feature.md`

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/types.ts` - Added `ModuleTool` interface
- `app/components/GeneralReportSettings.tsx` - Added tools UI, logic, and delete functionality
- `app-creation-log.md` - This entry

---

## 2025-10-23: Learning Outcomes Management Feature

### Update 5: Moved to Separate Page
**Restructured**: General Report Settings now has its own dedicated page, consistent with other Preview and Setup sections.

**Changes**:
- Created `/app/reports/[id]/preview/settings/page.tsx` - dedicated page for settings
- Main Preview and Setup tab now shows only a card with link (like other sections)
- Card displays: "⚙️ General Report Settings" with "Manage Settings" button
- Removed inline component from main tab
- Navigation pattern now consistent across all Preview and Setup items

**UX Benefits**:
- Cleaner main navigation page
- More space for settings functionality
- Consistent navigation pattern
- Better organization

---

### Update 4: UI Improvements - Show All Topics & Save Metadata
**Added**: 
1. Show all topics (removed 5-topic limit with "...more" text)
2. Added "Save Changes" button for report title and description

**Changes**:
- Removed `.slice(0, 5)` from topics display - now shows all topics
- Added `savingMetadata` and `metadataChanged` state tracking
- "💾 Save Changes" button appears only when title or description is modified
- Save button calls `PATCH /api/reports/[id]` to update metadata
- Success/error feedback with alerts

**UX**: Button appears only when changes are made, then disappears after successful save.

---

### Update 3: Fixed LLM API Configuration
**Fixed**: Changed `LITELLM_API_URL` to `LITELLM_BASE_URL` to match other API endpoints.

**Problem**: Generation failed because of wrong environment variable name.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `process.env.LITELLM_API_URL` → `process.env.LITELLM_BASE_URL`
- Updated documentation and env.example
- Now consistent with generate-manager-report and generate-student-report APIs

---

### Update 2: Fixed Course Structure Loading - Now Uses structure_data
**Changed**: Complete refactor to use `structure_data` from reports instead of `courseId`.

**Why**: 
- Original implementation fetched data by `courseId` which returned wrong/test data
- Other parts of the app use `structure_data` (from CSV) + Cogniterra API for real names
- This approach matches existing module analytics and student reports

**How it works now**:
1. Component receives `structure_data` from parent (report data)
2. Extracts unique `module_id` and `lesson_id` from structure
3. Calls `/api/cogniterra/course-structure` (POST) with `structureData`
4. API fetches real module names via `getModuleNamesMapByIds()`
5. API fetches real topic names via `getLessonNamesMapByIds()`
6. Builds complete structure with real names, positions, and step counts

**Changes**:
- `/api/cogniterra/course-structure/route.ts`: Changed from GET with `courseId` to POST with `structureData`
- `GeneralReportSettings`: Removed `courseId` prop, added `structureData` prop
- Removed manual Course ID input (not needed anymore)
- Fixed component to match approach used in `lib/utils/llm-data-helpers.ts`

---

### Update 1: Made Course ID Optional and API-First
**Changed**: Course structure is now fetched from Cogniterra API, not CSV files. Course ID can be entered manually if not auto-detected.

**Why**: 
- CSV structure files only contain IDs, not actual module/topic names
- Cogniterra API provides full module and topic titles
- More flexible: works even without structure CSV upload
- Better UX: real names instead of "Module 123"

---

### Overview
Added a comprehensive "General Report Settings" section to the Preview and Setup tab that allows admins to manage report metadata and generate AI-powered learning outcomes for each course module.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Database Schema
- **`supabase/add-learning-outcomes.sql`**:

## 2025-10-22: Improve Meetings Display Format in Reports

### Change: Show Total Meetings Count in Addition to Percentage

**Problem**: In the "Student Performance Overview" table, the meetings column showed "3/60%" which was confusing - it displayed attended meetings and percentage, but not the total number of meetings available.

**Solution**: Changed format to "3/5 (60%)" where:
- 3 = meetings attended
- 5 = total meetings available
- 60% = attendance percentage

**Implementation**:
- **`lib/types.ts`**: Added `total_meetings` field to `PerformanceRow` interface
- **`lib/processors/performance-processor.ts`**: 
  - Extracted `totalMeetings` from `meetingData.total`
  - Added `total_meetings` to results
- **`lib/utils/convert-blocks.ts`**: 
  - Updated meetings column format from `"3/60%"` to `"3/5 (60%)"`
  - Falls back to old format if total_meetings is 0

**Impact**:
- ✅ More intuitive meetings display
- ✅ Shows both absolute numbers (3 out of 5) and percentage (60%)
- ✅ Easier to understand meeting attendance context
- ✅ Applies to all shared manager reports
- ✅ **Automatically converts old format in existing reports** - no need to recreate reports!

**Backward Compatibility**:
- Added format conversion in `BlockViewer` and `BlockRenderer` components

## 2025-10-22: Update Segment Colors and Legend Order in Charts

### Change: Improve Visual Consistency in Pie Charts

**Problem**: 
1. "Moderately performing" segment used gray color instead of light green
2. "Low participation" appeared in random order in chart legend instead of at the bottom

**Solution**:
1. Changed "Moderately performing" color from gray to light green (rgba(134, 239, 172, 0.8))
2. Added sorting logic to always display segments in consistent order with "Low participation" last

**Implementation**:
- **`app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx`**: 
  - Updated color logic for "Moderately performing" segments
  - Added `getSegmentSortOrder()` function to sort labels before rendering
  - Segments now always appear in order: Highly efficient → Highly engaged → Moderately engaged → Moderately performing → Highly effortful → Low participation

- **`app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx`**: 
  - Applied same color and sorting changes for edit view

**Impact**:
- ✅ "Moderately performing" now shows in light green/mint (more positive visual)
- ✅ Chart legends display in consistent, logical order
- ✅ "Low participation" always appears at bottom of legend
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy in reports
- ✅ Table badges now show correct colors: green for "Highly" segments, mint for "Moderately performing", orange for "Highly effortful", red for "Low participation"

**Color Scheme (Chart and Badges now match exactly)**:
- **Highly efficient/engaged**: rgba(34, 197, 94) - Green
- **Moderately engaged**: rgba(59, 130, 246) - Blue
- **Moderately performing**: rgba(134, 239, 172) - Light Green
- **Highly effortful**: rgba(249, 115, 22) - Orange
- **Low participation**: rgba(239, 68, 68) - Red

**Technical Details**:
- Added comprehensive `getBadgeStyle()` function for ALL segment types
- Chart uses opacity 0.8, badges use opacity 0.15 for background (better readability)
- All badges now use exact same RGB values as pie chart slices
- Complete visual consistency between charts and table badges

**Files Modified**:
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx` - Updated colors, sorting, and table badge colors
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx` - Updated colors, sorting, and table badge colors

## 2025-10-22: Rename Student Segments for Better Clarity

### Change: Update Segment Names Throughout the Application

**Problem**: The original segment names were not intuitive and could be confusing for users reading reports.

**Solution**: Renamed all student segments to more descriptive names:
- "Leader engaged" → "Highly engaged"
- "Leader efficient" → "Highly efficient"
- "Balanced + engaged" → "Moderately engaged"
- "Balanced middle" → "Moderately performing"
- "Hardworking but struggling" → "Highly effortful"
- "Low engagement" → "Low participation"

**Implementation**:
- **`lib/processors/performance-processor.ts`**: Updated segment assignment logic
- **`app/components/PerformanceResults.tsx`**: Updated color mapping and legend
- **`app/components/TableLegend.tsx`**: Updated legend descriptions
- **`app/reports/[id]/preview/students/page.tsx`**: Updated color mapping
- **`app/student/[userId]/page.tsx`**: Updated color mapping
- **`lib/utils/convert-blocks.ts`**: Updated help text for shared reports
- **`app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx`**: Updated badge and chart colors

**Impact**:
- ✅ Consistent segment naming across all reports
- ✅ More intuitive names that better describe student behavior
- ✅ Updated in performance segmentation, shared reports, and LLM reports
- ✅ All color coding remains consistent with new names

**Files Modified**:
- 8 TypeScript/TSX files updated with new segment names
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx` - Added to fix shared report edit view

**Database Migration**:
- Created `supabase/migrate-segment-names-simple.sql` to update existing shared reports in database
- This migration uses text replacement to update segment names in all JSONB blocks stored in shared_reports table

**Note**: Existing shared reports in the database still contain old segment names. To update them:
1. Run the migration script: `supabase/migrate-segment-names-simple.sql`
2. Or recreate shared reports - new ones will automatically use new segment names

## 2025-10-22: Fix Report Description and Date Display Overlap

### Change: Add Proper Line Breaks Between Description and Dates

**Problem**: On the shared manager report preview page, the report description and creation/update dates were displayed on the same line, causing text to overlap and making it difficult to read. Example: "...value these employees can bring to the business after the training.Created: 20.10.2025 • Updated: 21.10.2025" (all on one line).

**Root Cause**: The `Text` components for description and dates in the shared report view were inline elements without explicit block-level styling, causing them to flow together on the same line.

**Solution**: 
1. Added `display: 'block'` style to description Text component to ensure it takes full width
2. Added `marginBottom: '8px'` to description for visual spacing
3. Added `display: 'block'` style to dates Text component to force it onto a new line
4. Removed `mt="2"` prop since we're using inline styles now

**Implementation**:
- **`app/reports/shared/[id]/view/page.tsx`** (lines 152-155):
  - Changed description: `<Text size="3" color="gray" style={{ display: 'block', marginBottom: '8px' }}>`
  - Changed dates: `<Text size="1" color="gray" style={{ display: 'block' }}>`

**Impact**:
- ✅ Description text appears on its own line(s)
- ✅ Creation/update dates appear on a separate line below
- ✅ Proper visual spacing between description and metadata
- ✅ Improved readability of shared report preview

**Files Modified**:
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/view/page.tsx` - Fixed description and dates display

## 2025-10-20: Fix Meeting Dates Display in Module Analytics

### Change: Show Actual Meeting Dates Instead of Activity Dates

**Problem**: In the Module Progress table, the dates shown under "Meetings" column were the student's first and last **submission activity dates** (e.g., Oct 4 - Oct 5), not the actual **meeting dates** attended (e.g., Sep 3, Sep 10, Oct 1, Oct 8).

**Root Cause**: The `ModuleAnalytics` component was displaying `first_activity_date` and `last_activity_date` from module stats, which represent when the student worked on the module, not when they attended meetings.

**Solution**: 
1. Added `meeting_dates` field to `ModuleStats` interface to store actual meeting dates
2. Modified `processModuleAnalytics()` to track and return the actual dates of meetings attended for each module
3. Updated `ModuleAnalytics` component to display the real meeting dates instead of activity dates

**Implementation**:
- **`lib/processors/module-analytics.ts`**:
  - Added `meeting_dates?: Date[]` to `ModuleStats` interface (line 21)
  - Modified meeting distribution logic to store actual meeting dates for each module (lines 224-280)
  - Tracks which meetings have been assigned to previous modules to avoid duplication
  - For last module, includes post-activity meetings
  
- **`app/components/ModuleAnalytics.tsx`**:
  - Changed meeting date display to use `module.meeting_dates` instead of `first_activity_date/last_activity_date` (lines 177-184)
  - Shows single date if only one meeting, or date range (first - last) if multiple meetings

**Impact**:
- ✅ Meeting dates now show **actual meeting attendance dates** (e.g., "Sep 3 - Oct 8")
- ✅ More accurate representation of when student participated in meetings
- ✅ Eliminates confusion between learning activity period and meeting attendance
- ✅ Easier to verify meeting attendance against calendar

**Example**: Student attended meetings on Sep 3, Sep 10, Oct 1, Oct 8 during "Agents" module - now shows "Sep 3 - Oct 8" instead of "Oct 4 - Oct 5" (their submission activity dates).

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/processors/module-analytics.ts` - Added meeting_dates tracking
- `app/components/ModuleAnalytics.tsx` - Updated date display logic

---

## 2025-10-20: Fix Meeting Attribution for Last Module

### Change: Include Post-Activity Meetings in Last Module

**Problem**: Meetings that occurred after the student's last submission activity (e.g., final wrap-up meetings, demo sessions) were not displayed on the module activity chart. For example, a student's last activity was on October 13, but they attended a course wrap-up meeting on October 15 - this meeting was not shown on the chart.

**Root Cause**: The algorithm only counted meetings that occurred **during** the active period of each module (from first to last submission). Meetings after all activity ended were not assigned to any module.

**Solution**: Modified the meeting distribution logic in `processModuleAnalytics()` to assign post-activity meetings to the last module:
- The algorithm still distributes meetings chronologically across modules based on activity periods
- For the **last module only**, any meetings that occurred after the module's last activity date are now included
- This captures final course events like wrap-up meetings, demos, and presentations

**Implementation**:
- Modified `lib/processors/module-analytics.ts`:
  - Added `isLastModule` flag in the distribution loop (line 227)
  - Added conditional logic for last module (lines 246-257)
  - Counts and adds remaining meetings that occurred after `last_activity_date`
  - These "hanging" meetings are now attributed to the final module

**Additional Fix - Missing Meetings Data in Current Session**:
- Fixed `app/results/page.tsx` to pass meetings, submissions, and structure data to `DynamicResults`
- Now the module activity charts work correctly in both saved reports AND current session
- Added `files` from context to access uploaded meetings data

**Impact**:
- ✅ Final wrap-up meetings now appear on student activity charts
- ✅ More accurate representation of student engagement throughout the entire course
- ✅ Captures attendance at course conclusion events (demos, presentations, etc.)
- ✅ Better visibility into student participation beyond just submission activity
- ✅ Works for ALL students (not just individual pages)
- ✅ Works in BOTH saved reports AND current analysis session
- ✅ Works in shared reports (through saved report data)

**Coverage Verified**:
1. ✅ Individual student pages (`/student/[userId]`) - uses savedReportData.meetings_data or files.meetings
2. ✅ Dynamic results for all students (`/results` and `/reports/[id]/preview/dynamic`) - now passes meetings data
3. ✅ Shared reports - uses saved meetings_data from database

**Example**: Student with last submission on Oct 13 attending wrap-up meeting on Oct 15 - the meeting now shows in the "Final" module bar on the chart across all views.

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/processors/module-analytics.ts` - Enhanced meeting distribution algorithm
- `app/results/page.tsx` - Added meetings data propagation to DynamicResults

**Implementation**:
- Modified `app/api/llm/generate-manager-report/route.ts`:
  - Updated system prompt for "Expert Observations & Project Highlights" section (lines 246-255)
  - Changed paragraph count from (2-3) to (3-5) to accommodate more projects
  - Added explicit rule: **"IMPORTANT: You must mention ALL student projects from the group"**
  - Provided guidance for organizing many projects (5+):
    - Group similar projects together
    - Highlight standout projects with more detail
    - Use final paragraph to acknowledge remaining projects
    - Ensure every student's project is mentioned by name
  - Emphasized making managers feel that each team member's contribution is valued

**Impact**:
- ✅ Every student's project will be mentioned in manager reports
- ✅ Better structure for reports with many projects (3-5 paragraphs)
- ✅ Managers get complete visibility of team's practical work
- ✅ All team members feel recognized and valued
- ✅ More actionable insights for business stakeholders

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/llm/generate-manager-report/route.ts` - Enhanced system prompt

## 2025-10-17: Hide Student Project Comments from Shared Reports List

### Change: Remove Student Project Comment Display

**Purpose**: Hide "Student Project Comment" blocks from the shared reports list on the `/reports/[id]/shared` page (constructor tab).

**Implementation**:
- Modified `app/reports/[id]/shared/page.tsx`:
  - Removed rendering of project_comment Card in the shared reports table (lines 768-774)
  - Card displayed student project comments in yellow box below report title/description
  - Comments remain stored in database and accessible through other views

**Result**: Student project comments are no longer visible in the shared reports list table, making the interface cleaner while preserving the data.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/reports/[id]/shared/page.tsx` - Removed project_comment Card from table display

---

## 2025-10-17: Segmentation Statistics Sorting & Help Text Updates

### Change 1: Custom Sorting for Segmentation Statistics Table

**Purpose**: Improve readability of shared report view by sorting segments in a meaningful order (Leader → Balanced → Low/Others) instead of by student count.

**Implementation**:
- Modified `lib/utils/convert-blocks.ts` line 67
- Changed sorting logic for `segmentTableData` from count-based to priority-based
- New sort order:
  1. Leader segments (all segments containing "leader")
  2. Balanced segments (all segments containing "balanced")
  3. Low engagement segments (all segments containing "low")
  4. Hardworking segments (all segments containing "hardworking")
  5. Others
- Within each priority group, segments are sorted alphabetically
- Affects manager reports in shared report view (`/reports/shared/[id]/view`)

### Change 2: Enhanced Segment Descriptions with Objective Metrics

**Purpose**: Make segment definitions clearer by showing exact metrics and thresholds used for classification, removing ambiguity about how students are categorized.

**Implementation**:
- Updated helpText for "Student Segmentation Distribution" pie chart (line 57)
- Updated helpText for "Segmentation Statistics" table (line 98)
- New descriptions explain exact criteria:
  - **Leader engaged**: Completion ≥80% + Meeting attendance ≥70%
  - **Leader efficient**: Completion ≥80% + Attempts per task ≤3 + Consistency ≥50%
  - **Balanced + engaged**: Completion 30-80% + Meeting attendance ≥60% + Consistency ≥40%
  - **Balanced middle**: Completion 30-80%
  - **Hardworking but struggling**: High effort + High struggle score (many attempts + low success rate)
  - **Low engagement**: Completion <30% with <20 submissions OR very low activity
- Added explanation of key metrics: completion rate, meeting attendance, effort index, consistency index, struggle index

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/utils/convert-blocks.ts` - Updated helpText for segment distribution chart and statistics table

## 2025-10-14: Group Module Analytics Fix

### Latest Update (Part 3): Fixed Meeting Attribution Logic in Module Analytics

**Purpose**: Fix the meeting counting logic to properly attribute meetings to modules, especially for the first module where meetings may occur before student activity begins.

**Problem**:
- Meetings that occurred **before** a student started working on a module were not being counted
- For example, Olga Bedrina attended a meeting on 03.09.2025 but started working on 08.09.2025
- The old logic only counted meetings between `firstActivityDate` and `lastActivityDate` of a module
- This caused meetings to be missed, especially for early course meetings

**Old Logic** (lines 193-207 in module-analytics.ts):
```typescript
// Count meetings that fall within the module period
const firstDate = new Date(firstTimestamp * 1000);
const lastDate = new Date(lastTimestamp * 1000);
firstDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
lastDate.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);

meetingsAttended = meetingDates.filter(m => {
  if (!m.attended) return false;
  const meetingDate = new Date(m.date);
  meetingDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  return meetingDate >= firstDate && meetingDate <= lastDate; // ❌ Strict range
}).length;
```

**New Logic** - Cumulative Meeting Distribution:
1. Sort modules by position (earliest to latest)
2. For each module:
   - Count ALL meetings up to the end of that module
   - Subtract meetings already counted for previous modules
   - This ensures each meeting is counted exactly once

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// For each module (sorted by position)
let previousMeetingsCount = 0;
for (const moduleResult of tempResults) {
  // Count all meetings up to end of this module
  const totalMeetingsUpToNow = meetingDates.filter(m => {
    if (!m.attended) return false;
    const meetingDate = new Date(m.date);
    return meetingDate <= lastDate;
  }).length;
  
  // This module's meetings = total up to now - previous modules
  meetingsAttended = totalMeetingsUpToNow - previousMeetingsCount;
  previousMeetingsCount = totalMeetingsUpToNow;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Meetings before first activity are now counted for the first module
- Each meeting is attributed to exactly one module
- Distribution follows chronological order
- More accurate representation of student engagement

**Files Modified**:
- `/lib/processors/module-analytics.ts` - Refactored meeting attribution logic

**Impact**:
- Charts and tables now correctly show meetings attended for each module
- First module includes meetings that occurred before student started working
- Overall meeting counts remain accurate

---

### Previous Update (Part 2): Fixed Module Analytics Data Calculation in convert-blocks.ts

**Purpose**: Fix the root cause of data discrepancy between shared report edit page and preview page - module analytics was calculating for only one student instead of averaging across all students.

**Problem**:
- Module analytics blocks in shared reports were using data from only the first student
- The `convert-blocks.ts` was calling `processModuleAnalytics()` once with `reportData.performanceData[0].user_id`
- This caused incorrect averages - showing one student's data but pretending it was group averages
- Data in shared report edit page differed from preview page which correctly calculates group averages

**Root Cause**:
In `/lib/utils/convert-blocks.ts` lines 202-208, the code was:
```typescript
const moduleStats = processModuleAnalytics(
  reportData.performanceData[0].user_id,  // ❌ Only first student!
  reportData.submissions || [],
  reportData.structure || [],
  moduleNamesMap,
  reportData.meetings || []
);
```

**Solution**:
1. **Updated Module Analytics Calculation** (`lib/utils/convert-blocks.ts`):
   - Now loops through ALL students in `reportData.performanceData`
   - Calls `processModuleAnalytics()` for each student individually
   - Calculates proper averages across all students:
     - `avg_completion_rate`
     - `avg_success_rate` 
     - `avg_attempts_per_step`
     - `avg_completed_steps`
     - `avg_meetings_attended`
   - Sorts final results by module position
   - Uses correct `avg_completed_steps` for chart (not percentage)

2. **Chart Data Fix**:
   - Changed chart data to use `finalStats` directly instead of `moduleTableData`
   - Now uses actual `avg_completed_steps` values instead of parsing completion percentage
   - Ensures chart matches the live preview implementation

**Files Modified**:
- `/lib/utils/convert-blocks.ts` - Fixed module analytics calculation logic

**Impact**:
- Shared report edit page now shows correct group averages matching the preview page
- All module analytics blocks display consistent data across the application
- Charts and tables show properly averaged statistics across all students

---

### Previous Update (Part 1): Fixed Module Analytics Display in Shared Reports

- Inconsistent display between shared reports and preview

**Changes**:

1. **Shared Report Block Creation** (`app/api/reports/shared/create/route.ts`):
   - Fixed data processing for module analytics blocks
   - Updated block structure to match preview implementation:
     ```typescript
     {
       type: 'group-module-analytics-chart',
       data: {
         moduleStats: processedModuleStats,
         chartConfig: {
           showMeetings: true,
           showCompletedSteps: true
         }
       }
     }
     ```

## 2025-10-10: Performance Metrics Improvements

### Previous Update: Reorganized Manager Report Block Order

**Purpose**: Improve logical flow and readability of manager shared reports by reordering blocks to follow a more intuitive narrative structure.

**New Block Order**:

1. **Executive Summary** - High-level overview
2. **Student Segmentation Distribution** (pie-chart) - Visual segment breakdown
3. **Segmentation Statistics** (table) - Detailed segment analysis
4. **Student Performance Overview** (table) - Complete student roster with metrics
5. **Team Engagement & Dynamics** - Group dynamics narrative
6. **Activity Pattern Distribution** (pie-chart) - Easing types visualization
7. **Activity Pattern Statistics** (table) - Detailed pattern analysis
8. **Skills Acquired & Learning Outcomes** - What students learned
9. **Group Activity by Module** (chart) - Visual module activity
10. **Group Performance by Module** (table) - Detailed module metrics
11. **Expert Observations & Project Highlights** - Instructor insights
12. **Program Expert Feedback** (if available) - Expert comments
13. **Teaching Assistants Feedback** (if available) - TA comments
14. **Learning Support Feedback** (if available) - Support comments
15. **Business Recommendations & Next Steps** - Actionable recommendations

**Rationale**:
- **Data → Insights → Actions**: Flow from raw data (charts/tables) to analysis (narratives) to recommendations
- **Performance First**: Student performance overview moved earlier (position 4) for immediate visibility
- **Grouped Analytics**: All segmentation blocks together, all pattern blocks together, all module blocks together
- **Skills Before Modules**: General outcomes before detailed module breakdown
- **Comments Before Recommendations**: Expert feedback informs final recommendations

**Changes Made**:
- Moved "Student Performance Overview" from position 8 to position 4
- Moved "Team Engagement & Dynamics" from position 5 to position 5 (no change, but now after performance table)
- Moved "Skills Acquired & Learning Outcomes" from position 4 to position 8
- Module analytics blocks (9-10) now come before expert observations
- All blocks properly numbered with comments for clarity

**Impact**:
- More logical reading flow for managers
- Key performance data visible earlier
- Better narrative structure from data to insights to actions
- Easier to understand report structure

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/reports/shared/create/route.ts`: Reorganized manager report block creation order

### Previous Update: Added Color Coding for Activity Patterns (Easing Types)

**Purpose**: Extend color coding system to Activity Pattern Distribution charts and tables, providing visual consistency across all report visualizations.

**Implementation**:

1. **Activity Pattern Colors** (Easing Types):
   - **Green** (`rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.8)`) - "ease-out" (Early start, front-loaders)
   - **Orange** (`rgba(249, 115, 22, 0.8)`) - "ease-in" (Late start)
   - **Purple** (`rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.8)`) - "ease-in-out" (S-curve)
   - **Blue** (`rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.8)`) - "ease" (Moderate, balanced)
   - **Gray** (`rgba(156, 163, 175, 0.8)`) - "linear" (Steady pace)
   - **Red** (`rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.8)`) - "no-activity" (No activity)

2. **Updated Components**:
   - Extended `getChartColor()` function to handle both segments and easing patterns
   - Extended `getBadgeColor()` function to return appropriate colors for patterns
   - Added Badge rendering for "pattern" column in tables
   - Unified color logic across BlockRenderer and BlockViewer

3. **Where Applied**:
   - **Pie Chart**: "Activity Pattern Distribution (Easing Types)"
   - **Table**: "Activity Pattern Statistics" - Pattern column now shows colored badges
   - Both edit and view modes

**Color Semantics**:
- **Green (ease-out)**: Positive - students started strong
- **Orange (ease-in)**: Caution - late starters, may need early engagement
- **Purple (ease-in-out)**: Neutral - balanced S-curve pattern
- **Blue (ease)**: Neutral - moderate, steady acceleration
- **Gray (linear)**: Neutral - consistent pace throughout
- **Red (no-activity)**: Alert - no activity detected

**Impact**:
- Visual consistency between Activity Pattern charts and tables
- Instant recognition of work patterns
- Easier to identify students who need early intervention (ease-in = orange)
- Professional, cohesive appearance across all visualizations

**Files Modified**:
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx`: Extended color logic for patterns
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx`: Extended color logic for patterns

---

### Previous Update: Unified Segment Colors Across Charts and Tables

**Purpose**: Ensure consistent color coding for student segments across all visualizations (pie charts and tables) in shared reports.

**Problem**: 
- Pie charts used generic colors (pink, blue, yellow, teal) that didn't match segment meanings
- Tables used semantic colors (green for leaders, red for low engagement, etc.)
- This inconsistency made it harder to quickly understand the data
- Users had to mentally map different colors to the same segments

**Solution**:
Updated Pie Chart color generation to use semantic colors matching table badges:

1. **Color Mapping**:
   - **Green** (`rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.8)`) - "Leader" segments (Leader engaged, Leader efficient)
   - **Red** (`rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.8)`) - "Low engagement" segments
   - **Orange** (`rgba(249, 115, 22, 0.8)`) - "Hardworking" segments
   - **Blue** (`rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.8)`) - "Engaged" segments (Balanced + engaged)
   - **Gray** (`rgba(156, 163, 175, 0.8)`) - "Balanced middle" segments (neutral, no badge color in table)
   - **Gray** (`rgba(156, 163, 175, 0.8)`) - Unknown/other segments

2. **Implementation**:
   - Added `getSegmentChartColor()` function to both BlockRenderer and BlockViewer
   - Function analyzes segment name and returns appropriate color
   - Colors are dynamically generated based on segment labels
   - Works for any number of segments

3. **Consistency**:
   - Pie chart colors now match table badge colors exactly
   - Same color logic used in both edit and view modes
   - Visual consistency across all segment visualizations

**Impact**:
- **Before**: Pink slice in pie chart, green badge in table for same "Leader engaged" segment
- **After**: Green slice in pie chart, green badge in table - instant visual consistency
- Easier to scan and understand reports
- Reduced cognitive load for users
- Professional, cohesive appearance

**Files Modified**:
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx`: Added segment color logic to PieChartBlock
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx`: Added segment color logic to PieChartBlockViewer

---

### Previous Update: Added Color-Coded Segment Badges in Shared Reports

**Purpose**: Improve visual clarity and readability of Student Performance Overview tables in shared reports by adding color-coded badges for student segments.

**Implementation**:
Added colored Badge components for the "segment" column in all shared report tables:

1. **BlockRenderer.tsx** (Edit mode):
   - Added `Badge` import from Radix UI
   - Created `getSegmentColor()` helper function
   - Modified TableBlock to render segment values as colored badges
   - Color mapping:
     - **Green**: "Leader" segments (Leader engaged, Leader efficient)
     - **Red**: "Low engagement" segments
     - **Orange**: "Hardworking" segments (Hardworking but struggling)
     - **Blue**: "Engaged" segments (Balanced + engaged)
     - **Gray**: Other segments (Balanced middle, etc.)

2. **BlockViewer.tsx** (View mode):
   - Same implementation as BlockRenderer for consistency
   - Ensures colored badges appear in both edit and view modes

**Visual Impact**:
- **Before**: Plain text segment names (e.g., "Leader engaged")
- **After**: Colored badges with same text (e.g., 🟢 "Leader engaged")

**Benefits**:
- Instant visual recognition of student performance categories
- Easier to scan large tables and identify patterns
- Consistent with segment colors used elsewhere in the app
- Improves accessibility through color + text combination

**Files Modified**:
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx`: Added Badge import and segment color logic
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx`: Added Badge import and segment color logic

### Previous Update: Removed Active Days Metric from All Tables

**Purpose**: Remove the Active Days metric from all Student Performance Overview tables and legends due to data quality issues and complexity in accurate calculation.

**Problem**: 
- Active Days calculation was unreliable due to varying data quality in submissions.csv
- Difficult to accurately determine course period boundaries
- Metric was confusing for users (absolute days vs. ratio)
- Percentile-based filtering helped but didn't fully solve the issue

**Solution**:
Removed Active Days from all locations:

1. **Manager Shared Report** (`app/api/reports/shared/create/route.ts`):
   - Removed `active_days` field from Student Performance Overview table
   - Updated columns config: removed `'active_days'` from columns array
   - Updated helpText: removed Active Days description

2. **Student Shared Report** (`app/api/reports/shared/create/route.ts`):
   - Removed `active_days` and `active_days_ratio` fields from Your Performance Overview table
   - Updated columns config: removed both metrics
   - Updated helpText: removed both descriptions

3. **Individual Student Page** (`app/student/[userId]/page.tsx`):
   - Removed Active Days box from Detailed Statistics section
   - Grid now shows: Submissions, Unique Steps, Persistence, Efficiency, Effort Index

4. **Performance Results Legend** (`app/components/PerformanceResults.tsx`):
   - Removed Active Days row from metrics explanation table

5. **Table Legend Component** (`app/components/TableLegend.tsx`):
   - Removed Active Days row from metrics explanation table

**Remaining Metrics**:
- **Consistency Index**: Still available (uses active_days_ratio internally but not displayed)
- **Effort Index**: Combines submissions and activity patterns
- **Meetings**: Clear, reliable metric
- **Success Rate, Persistence, Efficiency**: Core performance metrics

**Impact**:
- Cleaner, more reliable tables
- Focus on metrics that are accurately calculable
- Reduced user confusion
- Consistency metric still captures activity regularity

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/reports/shared/create/route.ts`: Removed from both manager and student report blocks
- `app/student/[userId]/page.tsx`: Removed from Detailed Statistics
- `app/components/PerformanceResults.tsx`: Removed from legend
- `app/components/TableLegend.tsx`: Removed from legend

### Previous Update: Auto-Detect CSV Delimiter (Comma vs Semicolon)

**Purpose**: Support CSV files with different delimiters (comma `,` or semicolon `;`) to accommodate files from different sources (Excel exports, TeamCity, etc.).

**Problem**: 
- New meetings CSV file from TeamCity used semicolon (`;`) as delimiter
- CSV parser only supported comma (`,`) delimiter by default
- File was parsed as single column, showing all data in one field
- Common issue when receiving CSV files from different systems/regions

**Solution** (`lib/utils/csv-parser.ts`):
1. **Auto-detect delimiter before parsing**:
   - Count occurrences of commas and semicolons in first line
   - Use semicolon if it appears more frequently than comma
   - Default to comma if counts are equal

2. **Pass detected delimiter to parser**:
   - Use `delimiter` option in `csv-parse` library
   - Ensures correct column separation regardless of source

**Example**:
- **Comma format**: `user_id,name,meeting1,meeting2`
- **Semicolon format**: `user_id;name;meeting1;meeting2`
- Both formats now work automatically

**Impact**:
- Supports CSV files from Excel (often uses semicolon in EU)
- Supports CSV files from TeamCity and other systems
- No manual conversion needed
- Automatic detection is transparent to users

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/utils/csv-parser.ts`: Added delimiter auto-detection logic

---

### Previous Update: Fixed Active Days Calculation with Course Period Filter

**Purpose**: Ensure Active Days metric accurately reflects student activity within the actual course period, preventing inflated values from submissions outside the course dates.

**Problem**: 
- Active Days was showing 95 days for a student when the course only lasted ~54 days
- The metric was counting all unique submission dates without filtering by course period
- This could include submissions made before course start or after course end

**Solution**:
1. **Added Percentile-Based Course Period Detection** (`lib/processors/performance-processor.ts`):
   - Collect all submission timestamps in first pass
   - Sort timestamps and use 5th-95th percentile to determine course period
   - This automatically excludes outlier submissions (top 5% and bottom 5%)
   - Calculate `courseStartDate`, `courseEndDate`, and `courseDurationDays` from percentiles

2. **Added Submission Filtering**:
   - In second pass, filter out submissions that fall outside the percentile-based course period
   - Skip submissions where `ts.isBefore(courseStartDate) || ts.isAfter(courseEndDate)`
   - Only count dates within the actual course period for `active_days`

3. **Updated Active Days Ratio Calculation**:
   - Changed from individual student span to course-wide duration
   - Use `courseDurationDays` (from percentile range) instead of per-student `spanDays`
   - More accurate representation of activity relative to course length

**Why Percentile-Based Approach**:
- Using min/max dates would include outliers (e.g., test submissions, late submissions)
- 5th-95th percentile captures the main course period where 90% of activity occurred
- Automatically adapts to different course structures and durations
- Prevents single outlier submissions from inflating the course period

**Impact**:
- Active Days now shows realistic values (e.g., 45 days instead of 95 days)
- Active Days Ratio is calculated against actual course duration
- More accurate performance metrics for student engagement
- Prevents outlier submissions from skewing statistics

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/processors/performance-processor.ts`: Added course period detection and filtering logic

### Previous Update: Data Consistency Verification and Fixes

**Purpose**: Ensure all blocks in shared reports use the same data structures and formatting as their corresponding pages (performance, dynamic, student).

**Issues Found and Fixed**:
1. **Performance Metrics - Success Rate Bug**:
   - **Issue**: `success_rate` was being multiplied by 100 twice in shared reports
   - **Root cause**: `PerformanceRow.success_rate` is already a percentage (0-100) from the processor
   - **Fix**: Removed extra `* 100` multiplication in shared report creation
   - **Impact**: Success rate now displays correctly (e.g., 78.5% instead of 7850%)

**Verification Completed**:
- ✅ **Performance Metrics**: Uses same `PerformanceRow` data structure, correct formatting
- ✅ **Activity Dynamics**: Uses same `DynamicSummaryRow` data, appropriate formatting for table context
- ✅ **Topic Performance**: Uses same lesson-based grouping with real lesson names from Cogniterra API
- ✅ **Module Analytics**: Uses identical `processModuleAnalytics()` processor as student page
- ✅ **Module Activity Chart**: Uses same `moduleStats` data from `processModuleAnalytics()`

**Result**: All shared report blocks now display data consistently with their source pages.

## 2025-10-06: Refactor - Overall Engagement vs Weekly Momentum

### Breaking Change: Removed Weekly Momentum Calculation
**Rationale**: Student reports are for evaluating overall course results, not recent trends. Weekly momentum (last 7 vs previous 7 days) is not relevant for summative assessment at course completion.

### Changes
**Type System**:
- Replaced `StudentMomentum` with `StudentEngagement`
- `StudentEngagement` includes: level (High/Medium/Low), description, active_days_ratio

**Processor Logic** (`student-report-processor.ts`):
- Removed `calculateMomentum()` function
- Added `calculateEngagement()` function based on entire course period
- Engagement = average of (active_days_ratio + consistency from dynamic analysis)
- High: ≥60%, Medium: 30-60%, Low: <30%

**Signal Extraction**:
- Removed momentum-based focus signals: `momentum_down`, `end_dropoff` (with momentum condition)
- Added overall pattern signals: `high_burstiness` (>0.8), `early_dropoff` (without momentum)
- Updated `extractFocus()` to remove `series` parameter (no longer needed)

**Highlights Generation**:
- Updated text to emphasize overall course patterns
- "Overall engagement" instead of "recent activity"
- "Throughout the course" instead of "this week"
- "Pattern shows" instead of "activity dipped"

**Next Steps Generation**:
- Removed momentum-based suggestions ("Plan two short sessions this week")
- Added engagement-based suggestions ("Establish regular study schedule")
- Added burstiness-based suggestions ("Create more regular study rhythm")
- Suggestions now focus on overall habits, not weekly fixes

**UI Changes** (`app/student/[userId]/page.tsx`):
- Replaced "Recent Activity" card with "Overall Engagement" card
- Emoji indicators: 🔥 High, 📊 Medium, 💤 Low (was 📈📉➡️)
- Description shows total active days across full period
- Removed `getMomentumColor()`, added `getEngagementColor()`

### Benefits
1. **More relevant**: Summative assessment vs formative feedback
2. **Clearer insights**: Overall learning patterns vs weekly fluctuations
3. **Better actionable advice**: Long-term habits vs short-term fixes
4. **Consistent purpose**: Report evaluates course completion, not ongoing progress

### Algorithm Alignment
Modified from Personal Student Report Algorithm v1:
- Kept: §3 (Wins & Focus), §5 (Topic selection), §6 (Next steps structure), §7 (Curve explanation)
- Removed: §4 (Momentum last 7 vs previous 7)
- Added: Overall engagement calculation (active days ratio + consistency)

---

## 2025-10-06: Personalized Student Report Feature

### Major Feature: Individual Student Detail Pages
- Implemented comprehensive student detail pages accessible via clickable names in results tables
- Based on **Personal Student Report Algorithm v1** specification
- Full integration with existing Performance v3 and Dynamic/Easing v3 pipelines

### New Type Definitions
Added to `lib/types.ts`:
- `StudentTopic`: Topic-level analysis with labels (Comfortable/Watch/Attention)
- `StudentMomentum`: Weekly momentum tracking (Up/Flat/Down/Unknown)
- `StudentHighlight`: Wins and focus areas for student
- `StudentReport`: Complete personal report structure with all signals

### New Processor: student-report-processor.ts
**Core Functions**:
1. `generateStudentReport()`: Main entry point, orchestrates all signal extraction
2. `generateTopicTable()`: Synthesizes topics from step-level submissions data
3. `extractWins()`: Identifies positive signals (achievement, consistency, steady work, early progress)
4. `extractFocus()`: Identifies attention areas (struggling topics, low consistency, momentum down, easing risks)
5. `calculateMomentum()`: Computes last 7 days vs previous 7 days trend
6. `generateHighlights()`: Creates 3-5 plain-English bullets (wins first, then focus)
7. `generateNextSteps()`: Produces 2-3 actionable suggestions prioritized by impact

**Topic Analysis**:
- Groups steps into synthetic topics (every 10 steps = 1 topic)
- Calculates per-topic metrics: attempts/step, first-pass rate, deltas from course average
- Assigns labels: Comfortable (doing well) / Watch (needs attention) / Attention (requires review)
- Computes topic_score for prioritization (higher = more attention needed)

**Signal Extraction Logic**:
- **Wins** (candidates):
  - High score (≥80%) or success rate (≥85%)
  - Strong consistency (≥0.5)
  - Low burstiness (≤0.6) - steady work pattern
  - Positive frontload index (≥0.10) - early progress
  - Comfortable topics with high first-pass rate (≥0.7)
  
- **Focus** (candidates):
  - Topics labeled Watch/Attention
  - High struggle index (≥0.6)
  - Low active days ratio (<0.3)
  - Momentum down (≥15% decrease)
  - Easing risks: ease-in with late start (t25 > 0.4), ease-out with dropoff (t75 < 0.6)

**Momentum Calculation**:
- Requires ≥14 days of data
- Compares last 7 days total activity vs previous 7 days
- Delta ≥ +15% = Up, ≤ -15% = Down, else Flat

**Next Steps Generator**:
Priority order:
1. Focus on #1 attention topic (if exists)
2. Plan short sessions if momentum down
3. Join webinar if attendance < 40%
4. Maintain rhythm / build consistency (fallback)

### New Route: /student/[userId]/page.tsx
**Student Detail Page Components**:
1. **Header Card**: Name, user ID, segment badge, easing badge, key scores
2. **Highlights Section**: 3-5 actionable bullets with visual distinction (wins in green, focus in orange)
3. **Momentum Card**: Recent activity trend with emoji indicator and explanation
4. **Activity Curve Card**: 
   - Frontload index, consistency, burstiness metrics
   - Progress quartiles (t25/t50/t75)
   - Interactive EasingChart visualization
   - Plain-English curve explanation
5. **Topics Grid**: 
   - "Going Well" (green) - comfortable topics
   - "Focus Areas" (orange) - topics needing attention
6. **Next Steps Card**: Numbered action items (1-3 suggestions)
7. **Detailed Statistics**: Full performance metrics, meeting attendance
8. **Topic Analysis Table**: Complete breakdown with labels, deltas from average, evidence quality

**UI/UX Features**:
- All terms include hover tooltips and legend explanations
- Color-coded badges for quick visual scanning
- Delta indicators show +/- from course average
- Evidence quality warnings for low-data topics
- Responsive grid layouts
- Smooth animations on load

### Updated Result Tables
**PerformanceResults.tsx**:
- Added clickable student names (underline on hover)
- Names link to `/student/[userId]` detail page
- Row hover effect for better UX

**DynamicResults.tsx**:
- Added clickable student names (underline on hover)
- Names link to `/student/[userId]` detail page
- Retained "View curve" button for inline expansion

### Styling
**New CSS Module**: `app/student/[userId]/student.module.css`
- Fade-in animations for cards
- Responsive container with max-width
- Smooth transitions

**Updated**: `PerformanceResults.module.css`, `DynamicResults.module.css`
- `.clickableRow`: hover effect on table rows
- `.clickableName`: styled clickable names with accent color and underline animation

### Algorithm Alignment
Fully implements **Personal Student Report Algorithm v1**:
- ✅ Student-first language (plain English, no heavy statistics)
- ✅ Personal signal selection (top wins + focus items)
- ✅ Graceful degradation (handles missing meetings, short data spans)
- ✅ Transparent conclusions (all signals tied to specific metrics)
- ✅ Tone guidelines: supportive, actionable, wins before focus
- ✅ Edge cases: sparse data, no titles, conflicting signals

### Copy & Messaging
All student-facing text follows algorithm guidelines:
- Sentences limited to ~12-16 words
- One idea per bullet
- Supportive verbs ("review", "plan", "try") instead of negatives
- "Compared with the course" phrasing (no precise ranks)
- Wins presented first, focus paired with next steps

### Integration
- Seamlessly integrates with existing v3 pipelines
- No changes to data processing or upload flow
- Reuses existing chart components (EasingChart)
- Leverages AppContext for data access
- Zero impact on existing functionality

### English-Only Interface
- All UI text, legends, tooltips in English
- Metric names use standard terminology
- Explanations accessible to non-technical users
- Consistent with overall app localization

# App Creation Log

## 2025-10-03: Algorithm v3 - No External Activity File Required

### Major Rewrite: Removed activity.csv Requirement
- **REMOVED activity.csv** - No longer required or supported
- All activity metrics now derived from `submissions.csv` only
- Upload flow simplified back to 3 required files (grade_book, learners, submissions) + optional meetings
- Algorithm v3 spec: builds everything from existing data sources

### Type System Updates
- Removed `activity?: CSVFile` from `UploadedFiles`
- Removed `gamma` from `DisplaySettings` (only alpha, beta remain)
- Updated `PerformanceRow`:
  - Removed: `active_minutes_total`, `sessions_count`
  - Added: `active_days`, `correct_submissions` (explicit field)
  - Kept: `active_days_ratio`, `effort_index`, `consistency_index`, `struggle_index`
- Updated `DynamicSummaryRow`:
  - Added: `consistency`, `burstiness`
  - Kept: all Bezier parameters, frontload_index, easing_label
- Updated `DynamicSeriesRow`:
  - Removed: `activity_minutes` (third source)
  - Kept: `activity_platform`, `activity_meetings` (two sources only)

### Processing Logic - Complete Rewrite

#### Dynamic Processor (v3)
**Activity Derivation from Submissions**:
```
Platform Activity = Σ(correct: 1.0, incorrect: 0.25) per day
Composite Activity = α * Platform + β * Meetings
```
- Weights submissions by status: correct=1.0, incorrect=0.25
- Two-source blending only: platform + meetings (no third source)
- Default weights: α=1.0, β=1.5
- **New metrics**:
  - `consistency`: #days with activity / span_days
  - `burstiness`: std(activity) / mean(activity)

#### Performance Processor (v3)
**Activity Signals from Submissions**:
- `active_days`: n_distinct(date from timestamps)
- `active_days_ratio`: active_days / span_days
- `effort_index`: z-score(submissions) ⊕ z-score(active_days)
- `consistency_index`: same as active_days_ratio
- `struggle_index`: computed from persistence + success_rate signals

**Updated Segmentation Rules** (v3 spec):
1. Leader engaged: total_pct ≥ 80 AND meetings ≥ 70%
2. Leader efficient: total_pct ≥ 80 AND persistence ≤ 3 AND consistency ≥ 0.5
3. Balanced + engaged: 30-80% AND meetings ≥ 60% AND consistency ≥ 0.4
4. Hardworking but struggling: effort ≥ 0.5 AND struggle ≥ 0.6
5. Low engagement: (total < 30 AND submissions < 20) OR (effort ≤ -0.5 AND consistency < 0.3)
6. Balanced middle: else

### UI Updates
- Upload page: removed Activity tile (back to 4 tiles: 3 required + 1 optional)
- Processing page: updated logs ("Building activity curves from submissions...")
- Removed validation for activity.csv
- Updated context: removed gamma from initialSettings

### Algorithm Alignment
- Full v3 implementation per updated specs
- `docs/easing_activity_algorithm_node.md` (v3): No external files, submissions-only
- `docs/student-segment.md` (v3): Activity signals from submissions
- Zero external dependencies beyond core 3 files

- Updated CSV requirements section

## 2025-10-03: Activity.csv Integration Update (DEPRECATED - See v3 above)

### Major Update: Added activity.csv as Required Input
- **New required file**: `activity.csv` with fields: `user_id`, `timestamp`, `active_minutes`, `sessions` (optional)
- Updated upload flow to include 5 files (was 4)
- Activity data now drives both performance and dynamic segmentation algorithms

### Type System Updates
- Added `activity?: CSVFile` to `UploadedFiles` interface
- Extended `PerformanceRow` with activity-derived metrics:
  - `active_minutes_total`: Sum of all active minutes
  - `sessions_count`: Total sessions count
  - `active_days_ratio`: Consistency metric (active days / total days)
  - `effort_index`: Z-score normalized effort (combines minutes + sessions)
  - `consistency_index`: Same as active_days_ratio
  - `struggle_index`: Derived from low success rate + high persistence
- Extended `DynamicSeriesRow` with `activity_minutes` field (separate from platform/meetings)
- Added scaling parameters to `DisplaySettings`: `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`

### Processing Logic Enhancements

#### Dynamic Processor (`lib/processors/dynamic-processor.ts`)
- Integrated activity.csv data into daily activity aggregation
- Implemented three-source blending: `α * platform + β * meetings + γ * activity`
- Default weights: α=1.0, β=1.5, γ=0.02 (≈1 point per 50 minutes)
- Activity minutes scaled with gamma factor: `gamma * minutes + 0.2 * gamma * sessions`
- Series now exports separate components: `activity_platform`, `activity_meetings`, `activity_minutes`

#### Performance Processor (`lib/processors/performance-processor.ts`)
- Added comprehensive activity data processing
- Implemented z-score normalization for effort indices
- Calculate per-user stats: total minutes, sessions, active days, date spans
- Compute activity-derived indices:
  - **Effort index**: Normalized combination of minutes + sessions
  - **Consistency index**: Active days ratio
  - **Struggle index**: Heuristic based on success rate and persistence
- Updated segmentation rules to include activity signals:
  - High effort + struggle → "Hardworking but struggling"
  - Low effort + low consistency → "Low engagement"
  - Consistent leaders → "Leader efficient" (requires active_days_ratio >= 0.5)

### CSV Parser Updates
- Added validation for `activity.csv` file
- Required columns: `user_id` (aliases: userid, uid, user) and `timestamp` (aliases: time, date)
- Optional but recommended: `active_minutes`, `sessions`

### UI Updates
- Upload page now shows 5 tiles (added Activity tile)
- File description: "Student activity data (user_id, timestamp, active_minutes)"
- Processing page validates activity.csv presence
- Settings context includes alpha, beta, gamma with defaults

- **lib/types.ts**: Added URL components to `StudentTopic`:
  - `lesson_id?: number`
  - `first_step_id?: number`
  - `unit_id?: number`
  - `course_id?: number`

#### 2. Upload System
- **app/upload/page.tsx**: Added `structure` as optional file type
- **lib/utils/csv-parser.ts**: Added validation for structure.csv (requires `step_id`, `lesson_id`)

#### 3. Processor Updates
- **lib/processors/student-report-processor.ts**:
  - Added `structure?: any[]` to `ProcessorInput`
  - Created `structureMap` to map `step_id` → `{lesson_id, unit_id, course_id}`
  - Extended topic aggregation to include URL components
  - Each topic now stores first step's structure data

#### 4. UI Updates
- **app/student/[userId]/page.tsx**:
  - Passed `structure` data to `generateStudentReport()`
  - Made topic names in Topic Analysis table clickable links
  - URL format: `https://cogniterra.org/lesson/{lesson_id}/step/{first_step_id}?unit={unit_id}`
  - Added hover effect for better UX
  - Links open in new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

#### 5. Data Flow
1. User uploads `structure.csv` (optional) with columns: `course_id`, `module_id`, `lesson_id`, `step_id`
2. System builds map: `step_id` → URL components
3. During topic generation, each topic stores structure data from its first step
4. UI renders clickable links when structure data is available
5. Fallback: plain text when structure not provided

### User Experience
- **With structure.csv**: Topic names become clickable links to Cogniterra
- **Without structure.csv**: Topic names display as plain text
- Hover effect indicates clickable links
- External links open in new tabs

### Technical Details

   - Structure map is built: `step_id` → `{lesson_id, unit_id, course_id}`
   - Topic aggregation includes structure data from first step
   - `lesson_id` is stored in topic performance data

2. **Rendering Logic**:
   - Table renderer checks if column is `topic` AND row has `lesson_id`
   - If both conditions met, renders clickable link
   - Otherwise, renders plain text
   - Graceful fallback when structure data not available

### User Experience
- **With structure.csv uploaded**: Topic names in student shared reports become clickable links
- **Without structure.csv**: Topics display as plain text (no errors)
- Consistent behavior with regular student reports
- Works in both edit and view modes

### Compatibility
- All existing shared reports continue to work without changes
- No breaking changes to shared report schema
- Feature works automatically if source report has structure data
- No changes needed to manager reports (they don't use topic tables)

## 2025-10-08: Shared Reports - Database Constraint Fix

### Issue
Users encountered a database error when trying to create multiple shared reports for the same student from the same source report:
```
duplicate key value violates unique constraint "shared_reports_source_report_id_user_id_report_type_key"
```

### Root Cause
The database schema had an overly restrictive unique constraint that prevented creating multiple shared reports for the same student from the same source report. This constraint was:
```sql
UNIQUE(source_report_id, user_id, report_type)
```

### Solution
**Database Schema Update:**
- **supabase/add-shared-reports.sql**: Removed the unique constraint
- **supabase/fix-shared-reports-constraint.sql**: Created migration script to drop existing constraint

**Migration Required:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE shared_reports 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS shared_reports_source_report_id_user_id_report_type_key;
```

### Impact
- ✅ Admins can now create multiple shared reports for the same student
- ✅ Different block configurations can be shared with the same student
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Better flexibility for report customization

### User Experience
- No more "duplicate key" errors when sharing reports
- Multiple shared report versions per student are now supported
- Each shared report can have different block configurations

## 2025-10-08: Fixed Student Comments Status Logic

### Issue
The "Expert Comments" status for student reports was incorrectly showing as completed when program-level comments were filled, instead of checking for individual student comments.

### Solution
**Separated Comment Status Logic:**
- **Manager Comments**: Checks program-level comments (`comment_program_expert`, `comment_teaching_assistants`, `comment_learning_support`)
- **Student Comments**: Checks individual student comments in `student_comments` table

**Enhanced Student Comments Interface:**
- **Accordion Component**: Added collapsible section with individual student links
- **Direct Navigation**: Each student has a button linking to their personal report page (`/student/[userId]?reportId=[reportId]`)
- **Individual Management**: Comments are managed per student, not globally

### Changes Made

#### 1. State Management Update
- **app/reports/[id]/shared/page.tsx**:
  - Split `hasComments` into `hasManagerComments` and `hasStudentComments`
  - Updated status checking logic to differentiate between comment types

#### 2. Status Check Logic
- **Manager Comments**: Checks `reports` table for program-level comments
- **Student Comments**: Checks `student_comments` table for individual student comments
- **Independent Status**: Each type has its own status indicator

#### 3. Student Comments Interface
- **Accordion Design**: Collapsible section titled "👥 View Individual Student Reports"
- **Student Links**: Individual buttons for each student linking to `/student/[userId]?reportId=[reportId]`
- **Clear Labeling**: "👤 [Student Name] - Add/Edit Comments"

#### 4. Visual Indicators
- **Manager Section**: Shows status based on program-level comments
- **Student Section**: Shows status based on individual student comments
- **Color Coding**: Green for completed, orange for pending

### Technical Implementation
1. **Database Queries**: Separate queries for manager vs student comments
2. **State Separation**: Independent status tracking for each comment type
3. **UI Components**: Accordion with dynamic student list
4. **Navigation**: Direct links to individual student report pages

### User Experience
- **Accurate Status**: Student comments status now reflects actual individual comments
- **Easy Access**: Accordion provides quick access to all student report pages
- **Clear Separation**: Manager and student comment requirements are clearly distinguished
- **Individual Management**: Each student's comments can be managed independently

## 2025-10-08: Fixed Supabase Foreign Key Relationship Error

### Overview
Fixed the foreign key relationship error that was preventing shared reports from loading on the Access Management page.

### Problem Identified
- **Error**: `Could not find a relationship between 'shared_reports' and 'created_by' in the schema cache`
- **Cause**: Supabase query was trying to join `shared_reports.created_by` with `profiles.email` but the foreign key relationship wasn't properly configured
- **Impact**: Access Management page showed "No shared reports found" even when reports existed

### Changes Made

### Implementation

**Added data-attributes for PDF control** (`app/reports/shared/[id]/view/page.tsx`):
```typescript
// Hide badge in PDF
<Flex gap="2" mb="2" align="center" data-pdf-hide>
  <Badge color={report.report_type === 'manager' ? 'blue' : 'green'}>
    {report.report_type === 'manager' ? '📊 Manager Report' : '👤 Student Report'}
  </Badge>
</Flex>

// Hide footer in PDF
<Card data-pdf-hide>
  <Flex justify="between" align="center">
    <Text size="2" color="gray">Report ID: {report.id}</Text>
    {canEdit && <Button>Manage Access</Button>}
  </Flex>
</Card>
```

**Enhanced PDF generator** (`lib/utils/simple-pdf-generator.ts`):

1. **Hide marked elements**:
```typescript
// STEP 5: Hide elements marked with data-pdf-hide
const elementsToHide = clonedDoc.querySelectorAll('[data-pdf-hide]');
elementsToHide.forEach(el => {
  el.style.display = 'none';
});
```

2. **Expand all accordions**:
```typescript
// STEP 6: Expand all accordions
// Change data-state from "closed" to "open"
const dataStateElements = clonedDoc.querySelectorAll('[data-state]');
dataStateElements.forEach(el => {
  if (el.getAttribute('data-state') === 'closed') {
    el.setAttribute('data-state', 'open');
  }
  el.style.display = 'block';
  el.style.height = 'auto';
  el.style.maxHeight = 'none';
  el.style.overflow = 'visible';
});

// Make accordion regions visible
const accordionRegions = clonedDoc.querySelectorAll('[role="region"]');
accordionRegions.forEach(region => {
  region.style.display = 'block';
  region.style.height = 'auto';
  region.style.overflow = 'visible';
});

// Show all hidden elements (except those marked to hide)
const hiddenElements = clonedDoc.querySelectorAll('[style*="display: none"]');
hiddenElements.forEach(hidden => {
  if (!hidden.hasAttribute('data-pdf-hide') && !hidden.closest('[data-pdf-hide]')) {
    hidden.style.display = 'block';
  }
});
```

### Features

✅ **Clean PDF header** - No type badges, just title and description
✅ **No footer clutter** - Report ID and management buttons removed

   - Proper heading hierarchy (h1: 28px, h2: 22px, h3: 18px, etc.)
   - Better line-height (1.6) for readability
   - Color scheme: `#1a1a1a` for text, `#000` for headings

2. **Card-like Sections**
   ```css
   [class*="Card"], section {
     background: white;
     border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
     border-radius: 8px;
     padding: 16px;
     margin: 16px 0;
     box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
   }
   ```

3. **Enhanced Tables**
   - Better borders: `#d0d0d0`
   - Alternating row colors: `#fafafa`
   - Header styling: `#f5f5f5` background
   - Proper padding: `8px 10px`

4. **Visual Accordion Distinction**
   ```css
   [role="region"] {
     background: #fafafa;
     border-left: 3px solid #0066cc;
     border-radius: 4px;
     padding: 12px;
     margin: 12px 0;
   }
   ```

5. **Canvas/Chart Styling**
   - Border and padding for visual separation
   - Border-radius for modern look
   - Proper margins: `20px 0`

6. **Radix UI Class Support**
   - Preserved class names during cleanup
   - Added selectors for Radix size utilities (`size-1` through `size-8`)
   - Added selectors for spacing utilities (`mb-1` through `mb-5`, `mt-1` through `mt-5`)
   - Added selectors for gap utilities (`gap-1` through `gap-5`)
   - Color utilities (`color-gray`)

7. **Page Break Control**
   - Avoid breaking canvas, tables, and accordions
   - Support for manual page breaks

### Technical Implementation

**STEP 2 Modified**: Preserve class names
```typescript
// Remove inline styles but keep class names for CSS selectors
allElements.forEach(el => {
  if (!isCanvas && !isAccordion) {
    el.removeAttribute('style');
    // Keep class names - commented out: el.removeAttribute('class');
  }
});
```

**STEP 3 Enhanced**: Comprehensive CSS
- 180+ lines of carefully crafted CSS
- Responsive to Radix UI class patterns
- Professional spacing and typography
- Print-optimized colors and borders

### Benefits

✅ **Professional appearance** - Looks similar to web version

## 2025-10-09 (Night): Page Break Control

### Problem
PDF generation had poor page break behavior:
- Headings separated from their content (widows)
- Sections split across pages awkwardly
- No control over orphans and widows

### Solution: Advanced Page Break CSS

**Added comprehensive page break rules**:

1. **Heading Protection**
   ```css
   h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
     page-break-after: avoid;
     page-break-inside: avoid;
   }
   ```
   - Prevents headings from appearing alone at bottom of page
   - Keeps heading with its following content

2. **Section Integrity**
   ```css
   canvas, table, [role="region"], [class*="Card"], section {
     page-break-inside: avoid;
   }
   ```
   - Prevents breaking cards/sections in the middle
   - Keeps charts and tables intact
   - Accordion regions stay together

3. **Orphan and Widow Control**
   ```css
   body, p, div, li {
     orphans: 3;
     widows: 3;
   }
   ```
   - `orphans: 3` - minimum 3 lines at bottom of page
   - `widows: 3` - minimum 3 lines at top of page
   - Prevents single lines separated from paragraph

### Technical Details

**Page Break Properties**:
- `page-break-before: avoid` - Don't break before element
- `page-break-after: avoid` - Don't break after element
- `page-break-inside: avoid` - Don't break within element
- `orphans: 3` - Minimum lines at end of page
- `widows: 3` - Minimum lines at start of page

**Applied to**:
- All headings (h1-h6)
- Cards and sections
- Tables and charts
- Accordion regions
- Paragraphs and divs

### Benefits

✅ **No orphaned headings** - Headings stay with content
✅ **Intact sections** - Cards don't split awkwardly
✅ **Better readability** - No single lines separated
✅ **Professional appearance** - Clean page breaks
✅ **Preserved context** - Related content stays together

### Example

**Before**:
```
Page 1:
  ...
  Group Dynamics & Engagement
  
Page 2:
  Students in this cohort exhibited...
```

**After**:
```
Page 1:
  ...
  
Page 2:
  Group Dynamics & Engagement
  Students in this cohort exhibited...
```

### Files Modified

- `lib/utils/simple-pdf-generator.ts` - Added page break control CSS
- `app-creation-log.md` - Updated documentation

## 2025-10-09 (Late Night): Canvas to Image Conversion

### Problem
Despite all page break CSS rules, canvas elements (charts/graphs) were still being split across pages. This is a known limitation of `html2canvas` and PDF generation libraries - they don't reliably respect `page-break-inside: avoid` for canvas elements.

### Solution: Convert Canvas to Images

**Radical approach**: Convert all `<canvas>` elements to `<img>` elements BEFORE PDF generation.

**Why this works**:
- Images are better supported by PDF generators
- `page-break-inside: avoid` works reliably for images
- No canvas rendering issues in PDF
- Better compatibility across browsers

### Implementation

**STEP 5 - Canvas to Image Conversion**:
```typescript
// Find all canvas elements
const canvases = clonedDoc.querySelectorAll('canvas');

canvases.forEach((canvas) => {
  // Convert canvas to data URL
  const dataURL = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
  
  // Create image element
  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.src = dataURL;
  
  // Create protective wrapper
  const wrapper = document.createElement('div');
  wrapper.style.cssText = `
    page-break-inside: avoid !important;
    break-inside: avoid !important;
    margin: 30px 0 !important;
    padding: 20px !important;
    background: white !important;
    border: 1px solid #e0e0e0 !important;
  `;
  
  // Include heading if present
  if (headingToInclude) {
    wrapper.appendChild(headingToInclude);
  }
  
  // Add image to wrapper
  wrapper.appendChild(img);
  
  // Replace canvas with wrapper
  parent.insertBefore(wrapper, canvas);
  parent.removeChild(canvas);
});
```

### Key Features

1. **Canvas → PNG Conversion**
   - Uses `canvas.toDataURL('image/png')`
   - High quality image output
   - Preserves all chart details

2. **Protective Wrapper**
   - Each image wrapped in div with `page-break-inside: avoid`
   - Includes heading if found nearby
   - Styled with border and padding

3. **Heading Association**
   - Searches for h1-h6 before canvas
   - Includes heading in same wrapper
   - Keeps title and chart together

4. **Clean Replacement**
   - Original canvas removed
   - Image inserted in same position
   - No layout shifts

### Benefits

✅ **Reliable page breaks** - Images don't split
✅ **Heading protection** - Title stays with chart
✅ **Better compatibility** - Works across all PDF generators
✅ **High quality** - PNG format preserves details
✅ **Visual consistency** - Same appearance as web version
✅ **No canvas issues** - Eliminates canvas rendering problems

### Technical Details

**Image CSS**:
```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  page-break-inside: avoid;
  break-inside: avoid;
  display: block;
}
```

**Wrapper CSS** (inline):
- `page-break-inside: avoid !important`
- `break-inside: avoid !important`
- `margin: 30px 0`
- `padding: 20px`
- `border: 1px solid #e0e0e0`

### Console Output

```
📊 Found 2 canvas elements - converting to images
📊 Canvas 1: { width: 600, height: 400, hasData: true }
   Included heading "Activity Pattern Distribution..." with canvas 1
   Converted canvas 1 to image and wrapped in protective div
📊 Canvas 2: { width: 600, height: 400, hasData: true }
   Converted canvas 2 to image and wrapped in protective div
```

### Result

**Before**: Canvas elements split across pages
**After**: Charts converted to images, stay intact on single page

### Files Modified

- `lib/utils/simple-pdf-generator.ts` - Added canvas to image conversion in STEP 5
- `app-creation-log.md` - Updated documentation
