## 2025-10-14: Group Module Analytics Fix

### Latest Update (Part 3): Fixed Meeting Attribution Logic in Module Analytics

**Purpose**: Fix the meeting counting logic to properly attribute meetings to modules, especially for the first module where meetings may occur before student activity begins.

**Problem**:
- Meetings that occurred **before** a student started working on a module were not being counted
- For example, Olga Bedrina attended a meeting on 03.09.2025 but started working on 08.09.2025
- The old logic only counted meetings between `firstActivityDate` and `lastActivityDate` of a module
- This caused meetings to be missed, especially for early course meetings

**Old Logic** (lines 193-207 in module-analytics.ts):
```typescript
// Count meetings that fall within the module period
const firstDate = new Date(firstTimestamp * 1000);
const lastDate = new Date(lastTimestamp * 1000);
firstDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
lastDate.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);

meetingsAttended = meetingDates.filter(m => {
  if (!m.attended) return false;
  const meetingDate = new Date(m.date);
  meetingDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  return meetingDate >= firstDate && meetingDate <= lastDate; // ❌ Strict range
}).length;
```

**New Logic** - Cumulative Meeting Distribution:
1. Sort modules by position (earliest to latest)
2. For each module:
   - Count ALL meetings up to the end of that module
   - Subtract meetings already counted for previous modules
   - This ensures each meeting is counted exactly once

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// For each module (sorted by position)
let previousMeetingsCount = 0;
for (const moduleResult of tempResults) {
  // Count all meetings up to end of this module
  const totalMeetingsUpToNow = meetingDates.filter(m => {
    if (!m.attended) return false;
    const meetingDate = new Date(m.date);
    return meetingDate <= lastDate;
  }).length;
  
  // This module's meetings = total up to now - previous modules
  meetingsAttended = totalMeetingsUpToNow - previousMeetingsCount;
  previousMeetingsCount = totalMeetingsUpToNow;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Meetings before first activity are now counted for the first module
- Each meeting is attributed to exactly one module
- Distribution follows chronological order
- More accurate representation of student engagement

**Files Modified**:
- `/lib/processors/module-analytics.ts` - Refactored meeting attribution logic

**Impact**:
- Charts and tables now correctly show meetings attended for each module
- First module includes meetings that occurred before student started working
- Overall meeting counts remain accurate

### Previous Update (Part 2): Fixed Module Analytics Data Calculation in convert-blocks.ts

**Purpose**: Fix the root cause of data discrepancy between shared report edit page and preview page - module analytics was calculating for only one student instead of averaging across all students.

**Problem**:
- Module analytics blocks in shared reports were using data from only the first student
- The `convert-blocks.ts` was calling `processModuleAnalytics()` once with `reportData.performanceData[0].user_id`
- This caused incorrect averages - showing one student's data but pretending it was group averages
- Data in shared report edit page differed from preview page which correctly calculates group averages

**Root Cause**:
In `/lib/utils/convert-blocks.ts` lines 202-208, the code was:
```typescript
const moduleStats = processModuleAnalytics(
  reportData.performanceData[0].user_id,  // ❌ Only first student!
  reportData.submissions || [],
  reportData.structure || [],
  moduleNamesMap,
  reportData.meetings || []
);
```

**Solution**:
1. **Updated Module Analytics Calculation** (`lib/utils/convert-blocks.ts`):
   - Now loops through ALL students in `reportData.performanceData`
   - Calls `processModuleAnalytics()` for each student individually
   - Calculates proper averages across all students:
     - `avg_completion_rate`
     - `avg_success_rate` 
     - `avg_attempts_per_step`
     - `avg_completed_steps`
     - `avg_meetings_attended`
   - Sorts final results by module position
   - Uses correct `avg_completed_steps` for chart (not percentage)

2. **Chart Data Fix**:
   - Changed chart data to use `finalStats` directly instead of `moduleTableData`
   - Now uses actual `avg_completed_steps` values instead of parsing completion percentage
   - Ensures chart matches the live preview implementation

**Files Modified**:
- `/lib/utils/convert-blocks.ts` - Fixed module analytics calculation logic

**Impact**:
- Shared report edit page now shows correct group averages matching the preview page
- All module analytics blocks display consistent data across the application
- Charts and tables show properly averaged statistics across all students

---

### Previous Update (Part 1): Fixed Module Analytics Display in Shared Reports

**Purpose**: Fix incorrect display and functionality of Group Activity by Module and Group Performance by Module blocks in shared reports to match the correct implementation from the preview page.

**Problem**:
- Module analytics blocks in shared reports showing incorrect data
- Chart visualization not matching preview page
- Performance metrics not properly calculated
- Inconsistent display between shared reports and preview

**Changes**:

1. **Shared Report Block Creation** (`app/api/reports/shared/create/route.ts`):
   - Fixed data processing for module analytics blocks
   - Updated block structure to match preview implementation:
     ```typescript
     {
       type: 'group-module-analytics-chart',
       data: {
         moduleStats: processedModuleStats,
         chartConfig: {
           showMeetings: true,
           showCompletedSteps: true
         }
       }
     }

## 2025-10-10: Performance Metrics Improvements

### Previous Update: Reorganized Manager Report Block Order

**Purpose**: Improve logical flow and readability of manager shared reports by reordering blocks to follow a more intuitive narrative structure.

**New Block Order**:

1. **Executive Summary** - High-level overview
2. **Student Segmentation Distribution** (pie-chart) - Visual segment breakdown
3. **Segmentation Statistics** (table) - Detailed segment analysis
4. **Student Performance Overview** (table) - Complete student roster with metrics
5. **Team Engagement & Dynamics** - Group dynamics narrative
6. **Activity Pattern Distribution** (pie-chart) - Easing types visualization
7. **Activity Pattern Statistics** (table) - Detailed pattern analysis
8. **Skills Acquired & Learning Outcomes** - What students learned
9. **Group Activity by Module** (chart) - Visual module activity
10. **Group Performance by Module** (table) - Detailed module metrics
11. **Expert Observations & Project Highlights** - Instructor insights
12. **Program Expert Feedback** (if available) - Expert comments
13. **Teaching Assistants Feedback** (if available) - TA comments
14. **Learning Support Feedback** (if available) - Support comments
15. **Business Recommendations & Next Steps** - Actionable recommendations

**Rationale**:
- **Data → Insights → Actions**: Flow from raw data (charts/tables) to analysis (narratives) to recommendations
- **Performance First**: Student performance overview moved earlier (position 4) for immediate visibility
- **Grouped Analytics**: All segmentation blocks together, all pattern blocks together, all module blocks together
- **Skills Before Modules**: General outcomes before detailed module breakdown
- **Comments Before Recommendations**: Expert feedback informs final recommendations

**Changes Made**:
- Moved "Student Performance Overview" from position 8 to position 4
- Moved "Team Engagement & Dynamics" from position 5 to position 5 (no change, but now after performance table)
- Moved "Skills Acquired & Learning Outcomes" from position 4 to position 8
- Module analytics blocks (9-10) now come before expert observations
- All blocks properly numbered with comments for clarity

**Impact**:
- More logical reading flow for managers
- Key performance data visible earlier
- Better narrative structure from data to insights to actions
- Easier to understand report structure

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/reports/shared/create/route.ts`: Reorganized manager report block creation order

### Previous Update: Added Color Coding for Activity Patterns (Easing Types)

**Purpose**: Extend color coding system to Activity Pattern Distribution charts and tables, providing visual consistency across all report visualizations.

**Implementation**:

1. **Activity Pattern Colors** (Easing Types):
   - **Green** (`rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.8)`) - "ease-out" (Early start, front-loaders)
   - **Orange** (`rgba(249, 115, 22, 0.8)`) - "ease-in" (Late start)
   - **Purple** (`rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.8)`) - "ease-in-out" (S-curve)
   - **Blue** (`rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.8)`) - "ease" (Moderate, balanced)
   - **Gray** (`rgba(156, 163, 175, 0.8)`) - "linear" (Steady pace)
   - **Red** (`rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.8)`) - "no-activity" (No activity)

2. **Updated Components**:
   - Extended `getChartColor()` function to handle both segments and easing patterns
   - Extended `getBadgeColor()` function to return appropriate colors for patterns
   - Added Badge rendering for "pattern" column in tables
   - Unified color logic across BlockRenderer and BlockViewer

3. **Where Applied**:
   - **Pie Chart**: "Activity Pattern Distribution (Easing Types)"
   - **Table**: "Activity Pattern Statistics" - Pattern column now shows colored badges
   - Both edit and view modes

**Color Semantics**:
- **Green (ease-out)**: Positive - students started strong
- **Orange (ease-in)**: Caution - late starters, may need early engagement
- **Purple (ease-in-out)**: Neutral - balanced S-curve pattern
- **Blue (ease)**: Neutral - moderate, steady acceleration
- **Gray (linear)**: Neutral - consistent pace throughout
- **Red (no-activity)**: Alert - no activity detected

**Impact**:
- Visual consistency between Activity Pattern charts and tables
- Instant recognition of work patterns
- Easier to identify students who need early intervention (ease-in = orange)
- Professional, cohesive appearance across all visualizations

**Files Modified**:
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx`: Extended color logic for patterns
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx`: Extended color logic for patterns

### Previous Update: Unified Segment Colors Across Charts and Tables

**Purpose**: Ensure consistent color coding for student segments across all visualizations (pie charts and tables) in shared reports.

**Problem**: 
- Pie charts used generic colors (pink, blue, yellow, teal) that didn't match segment meanings
- Tables used semantic colors (green for leaders, red for low engagement, etc.)
- This inconsistency made it harder to quickly understand the data
- Users had to mentally map different colors to the same segments

**Solution**:
Updated Pie Chart color generation to use semantic colors matching table badges:

1. **Color Mapping**:
   - **Green** (`rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.8)`) - "Leader" segments (Leader engaged, Leader efficient)
   - **Red** (`rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.8)`) - "Low engagement" segments
   - **Orange** (`rgba(249, 115, 22, 0.8)`) - "Hardworking" segments
   - **Blue** (`rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.8)`) - "Engaged" segments (Balanced + engaged)
   - **Gray** (`rgba(156, 163, 175, 0.8)`) - "Balanced middle" segments (neutral, no badge color in table)
   - **Gray** (`rgba(156, 163, 175, 0.8)`) - Unknown/other segments

2. **Implementation**:
   - Added `getSegmentChartColor()` function to both BlockRenderer and BlockViewer
   - Function analyzes segment name and returns appropriate color
   - Colors are dynamically generated based on segment labels
   - Works for any number of segments

3. **Consistency**:
   - Pie chart colors now match table badge colors exactly
   - Same color logic used in both edit and view modes
   - Visual consistency across all segment visualizations

**Impact**:
- **Before**: Pink slice in pie chart, green badge in table for same "Leader engaged" segment
- **After**: Green slice in pie chart, green badge in table - instant visual consistency
- Easier to scan and understand reports
- Reduced cognitive load for users
- Professional, cohesive appearance

**Files Modified**:
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx`: Added segment color logic to PieChartBlock
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx`: Added segment color logic to PieChartBlockViewer

---

### Previous Update: Added Color-Coded Segment Badges in Shared Reports

**Purpose**: Improve visual clarity and readability of Student Performance Overview tables in shared reports by adding color-coded badges for student segments.

**Implementation**:
Added colored Badge components for the "segment" column in all shared report tables:

1. **BlockRenderer.tsx** (Edit mode):
   - Added `Badge` import from Radix UI
   - Created `getSegmentColor()` helper function
   - Modified TableBlock to render segment values as colored badges
   - Color mapping:
     - **Green**: "Leader" segments (Leader engaged, Leader efficient)
     - **Red**: "Low engagement" segments
     - **Orange**: "Hardworking" segments (Hardworking but struggling)
     - **Blue**: "Engaged" segments (Balanced + engaged)
     - **Gray**: Other segments (Balanced middle, etc.)

2. **BlockViewer.tsx** (View mode):
   - Same implementation as BlockRenderer for consistency
   - Ensures colored badges appear in both edit and view modes

**Visual Impact**:
- **Before**: Plain text segment names (e.g., "Leader engaged")
- **After**: Colored badges with same text (e.g., 🟢 "Leader engaged")

**Benefits**:
- Instant visual recognition of student performance categories
- Easier to scan large tables and identify patterns
- Consistent with segment colors used elsewhere in the app
- Improves accessibility through color + text combination

**Files Modified**:
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx`: Added Badge import and segment color logic
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx`: Added Badge import and segment color logic

### Previous Update: Removed Active Days Metric from All Tables

**Purpose**: Remove the Active Days metric from all Student Performance Overview tables and legends due to data quality issues and complexity in accurate calculation.

**Problem**: 
- Active Days calculation was unreliable due to varying data quality in submissions.csv
- Difficult to accurately determine course period boundaries
- Metric was confusing for users (absolute days vs. ratio)
- Percentile-based filtering helped but didn't fully solve the issue

**Solution**:
Removed Active Days from all locations:

1. **Manager Shared Report** (`app/api/reports/shared/create/route.ts`):
   - Removed `active_days` field from Student Performance Overview table
   - Updated columns config: removed `'active_days'` from columns array
   - Updated helpText: removed Active Days description

2. **Student Shared Report** (`app/api/reports/shared/create/route.ts`):
   - Removed `active_days` and `active_days_ratio` fields from Your Performance Overview table
   - Updated columns config: removed both metrics
   - Updated helpText: removed both descriptions

3. **Individual Student Page** (`app/student/[userId]/page.tsx`):
   - Removed Active Days box from Detailed Statistics section
   - Grid now shows: Submissions, Unique Steps, Persistence, Efficiency, Effort Index

4. **Performance Results Legend** (`app/components/PerformanceResults.tsx`):
   - Removed Active Days row from metrics explanation table

5. **Table Legend Component** (`app/components/TableLegend.tsx`):
   - Removed Active Days row from metrics explanation table

**Remaining Metrics**:
- **Consistency Index**: Still available (uses active_days_ratio internally but not displayed)
- **Effort Index**: Combines submissions and activity patterns
- **Meetings**: Clear, reliable metric
- **Success Rate, Persistence, Efficiency**: Core performance metrics

**Impact**:
- Cleaner, more reliable tables
- Focus on metrics that are accurately calculable
- Reduced user confusion
- Consistency metric still captures activity regularity

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/reports/shared/create/route.ts`: Removed from both manager and student report blocks
- `app/student/[userId]/page.tsx`: Removed from Detailed Statistics
- `app/components/PerformanceResults.tsx`: Removed from legend
- `app/components/TableLegend.tsx`: Removed from legend

---

### Previous Update: Auto-Detect CSV Delimiter (Comma vs Semicolon)

**Purpose**: Support CSV files with different delimiters (comma `,` or semicolon `;`) to accommodate files from different sources (Excel exports, TeamCity, etc.).

**Problem**: 
- New meetings CSV file from TeamCity used semicolon (`;`) as delimiter
- CSV parser only supported comma (`,`) delimiter by default
- File was parsed as single column, showing all data in one field
- Common issue when receiving CSV files from different systems/regions

**Solution** (`lib/utils/csv-parser.ts`):
1. **Auto-detect delimiter before parsing**:
   - Count occurrences of commas and semicolons in first line
   - Use semicolon if it appears more frequently than comma
   - Default to comma if counts are equal

2. **Pass detected delimiter to parser**:
   - Use `delimiter` option in `csv-parse` library
   - Ensures correct column separation regardless of source

**Example**:
- **Comma format**: `user_id,name,meeting1,meeting2`
- **Semicolon format**: `user_id;name;meeting1;meeting2`
- Both formats now work automatically

**Impact**:
- Supports CSV files from Excel (often uses semicolon in EU)
- Supports CSV files from TeamCity and other systems
- No manual conversion needed
- Automatic detection is transparent to users

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/utils/csv-parser.ts`: Added delimiter auto-detection logic

---

### Previous Update: Fixed Active Days Calculation with Course Period Filter

**Purpose**: Ensure Active Days metric accurately reflects student activity within the actual course period, preventing inflated values from submissions outside the course dates.

**Problem**: 
- Active Days was showing 95 days for a student when the course only lasted ~54 days
- The metric was counting all unique submission dates without filtering by course period
- This could include submissions made before course start or after course end

**Solution**:
1. **Added Percentile-Based Course Period Detection** (`lib/processors/performance-processor.ts`):
   - Collect all submission timestamps in first pass
   - Sort timestamps and use 5th-95th percentile to determine course period
   - This automatically excludes outlier submissions (top 5% and bottom 5%)
   - Calculate `courseStartDate`, `courseEndDate`, and `courseDurationDays` from percentiles

2. **Added Submission Filtering**:
   - In second pass, filter out submissions that fall outside the percentile-based course period
   - Skip submissions where `ts.isBefore(courseStartDate) || ts.isAfter(courseEndDate)`
   - Only count dates within the actual course period for `active_days`

3. **Updated Active Days Ratio Calculation**:
   - Changed from individual student span to course-wide duration
   - Use `courseDurationDays` (from percentile range) instead of per-student `spanDays`
   - More accurate representation of activity relative to course length

**Why Percentile-Based Approach**:
- Using min/max dates would include outliers (e.g., test submissions, late submissions)
- 5th-95th percentile captures the main course period where 90% of activity occurred
- Automatically adapts to different course structures and durations
- Prevents single outlier submissions from inflating the course period

**Impact**:
- Active Days now shows realistic values (e.g., 45 days instead of 95 days)
- Active Days Ratio is calculated against actual course duration
- More accurate performance metrics for student engagement
- Prevents outlier submissions from skewing statistics

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/processors/performance-processor.ts`: Added course period detection and filtering logic

### Previous Update: Real Topic Names in LLM Context

**Purpose**: Provide LLM with real lesson names instead of synthetic "Topic 1, 2, 3..." for more accurate and specific report generation.

**Changes**:
1. **Updated Student Report LLM Generation** (`app/api/llm/generate-student-report/route.ts`):
   - Modified `getStudentSubmissionsStats()` to accept `structure` and `lessonNamesMap` parameters
   - Changed from synthetic topic grouping to real `lesson_id` grouping
   - Added lesson names fetching using `getLessonNamesMapByIds()`
   - `submissionsAnalysis.topicPerformance` now includes real lesson names
   - Added `lessonId` field to each topic for reference

2. **Updated Manager Report LLM Generation** (`app/api/llm/generate-manager-report/route.ts`):
   - Modified `getTopicDistribution()` to accept `structure` and `lessonNamesMap` parameters
   - Changed from synthetic topic grouping to real `lesson_id` grouping
   - Added lesson names fetching using `getLessonNamesMapByIds()`
   - `submissionsStats.topicDistribution` now uses real lesson names as keys

**Impact**:
- ✅ LLM now sees "Introduction to Python" instead of "Topic 1"
- ✅ LLM can provide specific feedback like "You struggled with Data Structures" instead of generic "Topic 3 needs work"
- ✅ Student reports are more personalized and actionable
- ✅ Manager reports reference actual course content by name
- ✅ Consistent with UI changes where topics show real names

**Example LLM Data Before:**
```json
{
  "topicPerformance": [
    {"topic": "Topic 1", "attempts": 45, "correctRate": 0.78},
    {"topic": "Topic 2", "attempts": 32, "correctRate": 0.65}
  ]
}
```

**Example LLM Data After:**
```json
{
  "topicPerformance": [
    {"topic": "Introduction to Python", "lessonId": 1001, "attempts": 45, "correctRate": 0.78},
    {"topic": "Data Types and Variables", "lessonId": 1002, "attempts": 32, "correctRate": 0.65}
  ]
}
```

### Previous Update: Data Consistency Verification and Fixes

**Purpose**: Ensure all blocks in shared reports use the same data structures and formatting as their corresponding pages (performance, dynamic, student).

**Issues Found and Fixed**:
1. **Performance Metrics - Success Rate Bug**:
   - **Issue**: `success_rate` was being multiplied by 100 twice in shared reports
   - **Root cause**: `PerformanceRow.success_rate` is already a percentage (0-100) from the processor
   - **Fix**: Removed extra `* 100` multiplication in shared report creation
   - **Impact**: Success rate now displays correctly (e.g., 78.5% instead of 7850%)

**Verification Completed**:
- ✅ **Performance Metrics**: Uses same `PerformanceRow` data structure, correct formatting
- ✅ **Activity Dynamics**: Uses same `DynamicSummaryRow` data, appropriate formatting for table context
- ✅ **Topic Performance**: Uses same lesson-based grouping with real lesson names from Cogniterra API
- ✅ **Module Analytics**: Uses identical `processModuleAnalytics()` processor as student page
- ✅ **Module Activity Chart**: Uses same `moduleStats` data from `processModuleAnalytics()`

**Result**: All shared report blocks now display data consistently with their source pages.

## 2025-10-06: LLM-Generated Reports Feature

### New Feature: AI-Powered Manager and Student Reports
**Purpose**: Enable admins to generate comprehensive, AI-summarized reports for managers and individual students using LiteLLM (GPT-4 via Hyperskill internal proxy).

### Changes

**Database Schema** (`supabase/add-llm-reports.sql`):
- Created `manager_reports` table:
  - Links to base `reports` table (one-to-one)
  - Stores `generated_content` (original AI output) and `edited_content` (admin edits)
  - `is_published` flag for visibility control
  - Unique constraint: one manager report per base report
- Created `student_reports` table:
  - Links to base `reports` table (one-to-many)
  - Stores per-student AI-generated content and edits
  - `is_published` flag for student visibility
  - Unique constraint: one student report per (report_id, user_id)
- RLS policies:
  - Students can view their own published reports
  - Managers can view all published reports
  - Admins can manage all reports (CRUD)

**API Routes**:
- `POST /api/llm/generate-manager-report`:
  - Accepts `reportId`
  - Fetches team data (performance, dynamics, comments)
  - Sends to GPT-4 with comprehensive system prompt
  - Stores result in `manager_reports` table
  - Returns generated content
- `POST /api/llm/generate-student-report`:

## 2025-10-06: Refactor - Overall Engagement vs Weekly Momentum

### Breaking Change: Removed Weekly Momentum Calculation
**Rationale**: Student reports are for evaluating overall course results, not recent trends. Weekly momentum (last 7 vs previous 7 days) is not relevant for summative assessment at course completion.

### Changes
**Type System**:
- Replaced `StudentMomentum` with `StudentEngagement`
- `StudentEngagement` includes: level (High/Medium/Low), description, active_days_ratio

**Processor Logic** (`student-report-processor.ts`):
- Removed `calculateMomentum()` function
- Added `calculateEngagement()` function based on entire course period
- Engagement = average of (active_days_ratio + consistency from dynamic analysis)
- High: ≥60%, Medium: 30-60%, Low: <30%

**Signal Extraction**:
- Removed momentum-based focus signals: `momentum_down`, `end_dropoff` (with momentum condition)
- Added overall pattern signals: `high_burstiness` (>0.8), `early_dropoff` (without momentum)
- Updated `extractFocus()` to remove `series` parameter (no longer needed)

**Highlights Generation**:
- Updated text to emphasize overall course patterns
- "Overall engagement" instead of "recent activity"
- "Throughout the course" instead of "this week"
- "Pattern shows" instead of "activity dipped"

**Next Steps Generation**:
- Removed momentum-based suggestions ("Plan two short sessions this week")
- Added engagement-based suggestions ("Establish regular study schedule")
- Added burstiness-based suggestions ("Create more regular study rhythm")
- Suggestions now focus on overall habits, not weekly fixes

**UI Changes** (`app/student/[userId]/page.tsx`):
- Replaced "Recent Activity" card with "Overall Engagement" card
- Emoji indicators: 🔥 High, 📊 Medium, 💤 Low (was 📈📉➡️)
- Description shows total active days across full period
- Removed `getMomentumColor()`, added `getEngagementColor()`

### Benefits
1. **More relevant**: Summative assessment vs formative feedback
2. **Clearer insights**: Overall learning patterns vs weekly fluctuations
3. **Better actionable advice**: Long-term habits vs short-term fixes
4. **Consistent purpose**: Report evaluates course completion, not ongoing progress

### Algorithm Alignment
Modified from Personal Student Report Algorithm v1:
- Kept: §3 (Wins & Focus), §5 (Topic selection), §6 (Next steps structure), §7 (Curve explanation)
- Removed: §4 (Momentum last 7 vs previous 7)
- Added: Overall engagement calculation (active days ratio + consistency)

---

## 2025-10-06: Personalized Student Report Feature

### Major Feature: Individual Student Detail Pages
- Implemented comprehensive student detail pages accessible via clickable names in results tables
- Based on **Personal Student Report Algorithm v1** specification
- Full integration with existing Performance v3 and Dynamic/Easing v3 pipelines

### New Type Definitions
Added to `lib/types.ts`:
- `StudentTopic`: Topic-level analysis with labels (Comfortable/Watch/Attention)
- `StudentMomentum`: Weekly momentum tracking (Up/Flat/Down/Unknown)
- `StudentHighlight`: Wins and focus areas for student
- `StudentReport`: Complete personal report structure with all signals

### New Processor: student-report-processor.ts
**Core Functions**:
1. `generateStudentReport()`: Main entry point, orchestrates all signal extraction
2. `generateTopicTable()`: Synthesizes topics from step-level submissions data
3. `extractWins()`: Identifies positive signals (achievement, consistency, steady work, early progress)
4. `extractFocus()`: Identifies attention areas (struggling topics, low consistency, momentum down, easing risks)
5. `calculateMomentum()`: Computes last 7 days vs previous 7 days trend
6. `generateHighlights()`: Creates 3-5 plain-English bullets (wins first, then focus)
7. `generateNextSteps()`: Produces 2-3 actionable suggestions prioritized by impact

**Topic Analysis**:
- Groups steps into synthetic topics (every 10 steps = 1 topic)
- Calculates per-topic metrics: attempts/step, first-pass rate, deltas from course average
- Assigns labels: Comfortable (doing well) / Watch (needs attention) / Attention (requires review)
- Computes topic_score for prioritization (higher = more attention needed)

**Signal Extraction Logic**:
- **Wins** (candidates):
  - High score (≥80%) or success rate (≥85%)
  - Strong consistency (≥0.5)
  - Low burstiness (≤0.6) - steady work pattern
  - Positive frontload index (≥0.10) - early progress
  - Comfortable topics with high first-pass rate (≥0.7)
  
- **Focus** (candidates):
  - Topics labeled Watch/Attention
  - High struggle index (≥0.6)
  - Low active days ratio (<0.3)
  - Momentum down (≥15% decrease)
  - Easing risks: ease-in with late start (t25 > 0.4), ease-out with dropoff (t75 < 0.6)

**Momentum Calculation**:
- Requires ≥14 days of data
- Compares last 7 days total activity vs previous 7 days
- Delta ≥ +15% = Up, ≤ -15% = Down, else Flat

**Next Steps Generator**:
Priority order:
1. Focus on #1 attention topic (if exists)
2. Plan short sessions if momentum down
3. Join webinar if attendance < 40%
4. Maintain rhythm / build consistency (fallback)

### New Route: /student/[userId]/page.tsx
**Student Detail Page Components**:
1. **Header Card**: Name, user ID, segment badge, easing badge, key scores
2. **Highlights Section**: 3-5 actionable bullets with visual distinction (wins in green, focus in orange)
3. **Momentum Card**: Recent activity trend with emoji indicator and explanation
4. **Activity Curve Card**: 
   - Frontload index, consistency, burstiness metrics
   - Progress quartiles (t25/t50/t75)
   - Interactive EasingChart visualization
   - Plain-English curve explanation
5. **Topics Grid**: 
   - "Going Well" (green) - comfortable topics
   - "Focus Areas" (orange) - topics needing attention
6. **Next Steps Card**: Numbered action items (1-3 suggestions)
7. **Detailed Statistics**: Full performance metrics, meeting attendance
8. **Topic Analysis Table**: Complete breakdown with labels, deltas from average, evidence quality

**UI/UX Features**:
- All terms include hover tooltips and legend explanations
- Color-coded badges for quick visual scanning
- Delta indicators show +/- from course average
- Evidence quality warnings for low-data topics
- Responsive grid layouts
- Smooth animations on load

### Updated Result Tables

- Names link to `/student/[userId]` detail page
- Row hover effect for better UX

**DynamicResults.tsx**:
- Added clickable student names (underline on hover)
- Names link to `/student/[userId]` detail page
- Retained "View curve" button for inline expansion

### Styling
**New CSS Module**: `app/student/[userId]/student.module.css`
- Fade-in animations for cards
- Responsive container with max-width
- Smooth transitions

**Updated**: `PerformanceResults.module.css`, `DynamicResults.module.css`
- `.clickableRow`: hover effect on table rows
- `.clickableName`: styled clickable names with accent color and underline animation

### Algorithm Alignment
Fully implements **Personal Student Report Algorithm v1**:
- ✅ Student-first language (plain English, no heavy statistics)
- ✅ Personal signal selection (top wins + focus items)
- ✅ Graceful degradation (handles missing meetings, short data spans)
- ✅ Transparent conclusions (all signals tied to specific metrics)
- ✅ Tone guidelines: supportive, actionable, wins before focus
- ✅ Edge cases: sparse data, no titles, conflicting signals

### Copy & Messaging
All student-facing text follows algorithm guidelines:
- Sentences limited to ~12-16 words
- One idea per bullet
- Supportive verbs ("review", "plan", "try") instead of negatives
- "Compared with the course" phrasing (no precise ranks)
- Wins presented first, focus paired with next steps

### Integration
- Seamlessly integrates with existing v3 pipelines
- No changes to data processing or upload flow
- Reuses existing chart components (EasingChart)
- Leverages AppContext for data access
- Zero impact on existing functionality

### English-Only Interface
- All UI text, legends, tooltips in English
- Metric names use standard terminology
- Explanations accessible to non-technical users
- Consistent with overall app localization

# App Creation Log

## 2025-10-03: Algorithm v3 - No External Activity File Required

### Major Rewrite: Removed activity.csv Requirement
- **REMOVED activity.csv** - No longer required or supported
- All activity metrics now derived from `submissions.csv` only
- Upload flow simplified back to 3 required files (grade_book, learners, submissions) + optional meetings
- Algorithm v3 spec: builds everything from existing data sources

### Type System Updates
- Removed `activity?: CSVFile` from `UploadedFiles`
- Removed `gamma` from `DisplaySettings` (only alpha, beta remain)
- Updated `PerformanceRow`:
  - Removed: `active_minutes_total`, `sessions_count`
  - Added: `active_days`, `correct_submissions` (explicit field)
  - Kept: `active_days_ratio`, `effort_index`, `consistency_index`, `struggle_index`
- Updated `DynamicSummaryRow`:
  - Added: `consistency`, `burstiness`
  - Kept: all Bezier parameters, frontload_index, easing_label
- Updated `DynamicSeriesRow`:
  - Removed: `activity_minutes` (third source)
  - Kept: `activity_platform`, `activity_meetings` (two sources only)

### Processing Logic - Complete Rewrite

#### Dynamic Processor (v3)
**Activity Derivation from Submissions**:
```
Platform Activity = Σ(correct: 1.0, incorrect: 0.25) per day
Composite Activity = α * Platform + β * Meetings
```
- Weights submissions by status: correct=1.0, incorrect=0.25
- Two-source blending only: platform + meetings (no third source)
- Default weights: α=1.0, β=1.5
- **New metrics**:
  - `consistency`: #days with activity / span_days
  - `burstiness`: std(activity) / mean(activity)

#### Performance Processor (v3)
**Activity Signals from Submissions**:
- `active_days`: n_distinct(date from timestamps)
- `active_days_ratio`: active_days / span_days
- `effort_index`: z-score(submissions) ⊕ z-score(active_days)
- `consistency_index`: same as active_days_ratio
- `struggle_index`: computed from persistence + success_rate signals

**Updated Segmentation Rules** (v3 spec):
1. Leader engaged: total_pct ≥ 80 AND meetings ≥ 70%
2. Leader efficient: total_pct ≥ 80 AND persistence ≤ 3 AND consistency ≥ 0.5
3. Balanced + engaged: 30-80% AND meetings ≥ 60% AND consistency ≥ 0.4
4. Hardworking but struggling: effort ≥ 0.5 AND struggle ≥ 0.6
5. Low engagement: (total < 30 AND submissions < 20) OR (effort ≤ -0.5 AND consistency < 0.3)
6. Balanced middle: else

### UI Updates
- Upload page: removed Activity tile (back to 4 tiles: 3 required + 1 optional)

  - `consistency_index`: Same as active_days_ratio
  - `struggle_index`: Derived from low success rate + high persistence
- Extended `DynamicSeriesRow` with `activity_minutes` field (separate from platform/meetings)
- Added scaling parameters to `DisplaySettings`: `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`

### Processing Logic Enhancements

#### Dynamic Processor (`lib/processors/dynamic-processor.ts`)
- Integrated activity.csv data into daily activity aggregation
- Implemented three-source blending: `α * platform + β * meetings + γ * activity`
- Default weights: α=1.0, β=1.5, γ=0.02 (≈1 point per 50 minutes)
- Activity minutes scaled with gamma factor: `gamma * minutes + 0.2 * gamma * sessions`
- Series now exports separate components: `activity_platform`, `activity_meetings`, `activity_minutes`

#### Performance Processor (`lib/processors/performance-processor.ts`)
- Added comprehensive activity data processing
- Implemented z-score normalization for effort indices
- Calculate per-user stats: total minutes, sessions, active days, date spans

- Updated segmentation rules to include activity signals:
  - High effort + struggle → "Hardworking but struggling"
  - Low effort + low consistency → "Low engagement"
  - Consistent leaders → "Leader efficient" (requires active_days_ratio >= 0.5)

### CSV Parser Updates
- Added validation for `activity.csv` file
- Required columns: `user_id` (aliases: userid, uid, user) and `timestamp` (aliases: time, date)

- **lib/types.ts**: Added URL components to `StudentTopic`:
  - `lesson_id?: number`
  - `first_step_id?: number`
  - `unit_id?: number`
  - `course_id?: number`

#### 2. Upload System
- **app/upload/page.tsx**: Added `structure` as optional file type
- **lib/utils/csv-parser.ts**: Added validation for structure.csv (requires `step_id`, `lesson_id`)

#### 3. Processor Updates
- **lib/processors/student-report-processor.ts**:
  - Added `structure?: any[]` to `ProcessorInput`
  - Created `structureMap` to map `step_id` → `{lesson_id, unit_id, course_id}`

- **Without structure.csv**: Topic names display as plain text
- Hover effect indicates clickable links
- External links open in new tabs

### Technical Details
- Optional file: app works without structure.csv
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Graceful fallback for missing data
- Structure data loaded once, used throughout student reports

---

## 2025-10-08: Shared Reports - Topic Links Integration

### Overview
Added support for clickable topic links to Cogniterra in student shared reports. This feature applies the same topic linking functionality from regular student reports to shared student reports.

### Changes Made

#### 1. API Updates - Shared Report Creation
- **app/api/reports/shared/create/route.ts**:
  - Added structure map building from `baseReport.structure_data`
  - Extended topic statistics to include `lesson_id`, `unit_id`, `course_id`
  - Topics now store first step's structure data for linking
  - Topic performance data includes `lesson_id` when available

#### 2. UI Updates - Block Rendering
- **app/reports/shared/[id]/view/BlockViewer.tsx**:
  - Updated `TableBlockViewer` to detect topic columns with `lesson_id`
  - Added clickable links to Cogniterra for topics with structure data
  - URL format: `https://cogniterra.org/lesson/{lesson_id}/step/1`
  - Applied hover effect for better UX
  - Links open in new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

- **app/reports/shared/[id]/edit/BlockRenderer.tsx**:
  - Updated `TableBlock` with same topic link logic
  - Links are displayed in both edit and view modes
  - Maintains consistent styling with regular student reports

### Technical Implementation
1. **Data Flow**:
   - Shared report creation fetches `structure_data` from base report
   - Structure map is built: `step_id` → `{lesson_id, unit_id, course_id}`
   - Topic aggregation includes structure data from first step
   - `lesson_id` is stored in topic performance data

2. **Rendering Logic**:
   - Table renderer checks if column is `topic` AND row has `lesson_id`

## 2025-10-08: Shared Reports - Database Constraint Fix

### Issue
Users encountered a database error when trying to create multiple shared reports for the same student from the same source report:
```
duplicate key value violates unique constraint "shared_reports_source_report_id_user_id_report_type_key"
```

### Root Cause
The database schema had an overly restrictive unique constraint that prevented creating multiple shared reports for the same student from the same source report. This constraint was:
```sql
UNIQUE(source_report_id, user_id, report_type)
```

### Solution
**Database Schema Update:**
- **supabase/add-shared-reports.sql**: Removed the unique constraint
- **supabase/fix-shared-reports-constraint.sql**: Created migration script to drop existing constraint

**Migration Required:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE shared_reports 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS shared_reports_source_report_id_user_id_report_type_key;
```

### Impact
- ✅ Admins can now create multiple shared reports for the same student
- ✅ Different block configurations can be shared with the same student
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Better flexibility for report customization

### User Experience
- No more "duplicate key" errors when sharing reports
- Multiple shared report versions per student are now supported
- Each shared report can have different block configurations

## 2025-10-09 (Evening): PDF Generation Improvements

### Problem
Initial PDF generation had multiple issues:
1. Empty PDFs being generated
2. Broken table layouts with unpredictable borders
3. Page layout changes during PDF generation
4. Charts and graphs not appearing in PDF output

### Solution: Migrated to html2pdf.js

**Installed**: `html2pdf.js` - a specialized library for HTML to PDF conversion

**Implementation** (`lib/utils/simple-pdf-generator.ts`):

```typescript
import html2pdf from 'html2pdf.js';

export async function generateSimplePDFFromElement(
  element: HTMLElement,
  filename: string
): Promise<void> {
  // Configuration
  const options = {
    margin: [10, 10, 10, 10] as [number, number, number, number],
    filename: filename,
    image: { type: 'jpeg' as const, quality: 0.98 },
    html2canvas: { 
      scale: 2,
      useCORS: true,
      allowTaint: true,
      backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
      logging: false,
      letterRendering: true,
      onclone: (clonedDoc: Document) => {
        // Remove Radix UI styles that cause issues
        const radixStyles = clonedDoc.querySelectorAll('style[data-radix], link[href*="radix"]');
        radixStyles.forEach(style => style.remove());
        
        // Apply clean, minimal styles
        const cleanStyle = clonedDoc.createElement('style');
        cleanStyle.textContent = `/* Clean styles for PDF */`;
        clonedDoc.head.appendChild(cleanStyle);
        
        // Ensure canvas elements are visible
        const canvases = clonedDoc.querySelectorAll('canvas');
        canvases.forEach((canvas) => {
          const htmlCanvas = canvas as HTMLCanvasElement;
          htmlCanvas.style.display = 'block';
          htmlCanvas.style.visibility = 'visible';
          htmlCanvas.style.opacity = '1';
        });
      }
    },
    jsPDF: { 
      unit: 'mm' as const, 
      format: 'a4' as const, 
      orientation: 'portrait' as const,
      compress: true
    },
    pagebreak: { 
      mode: ['avoid-all', 'css', 'legacy'],
      avoid: ['canvas', 'img', 'table']
    }
  };
  
  await html2pdf().set(options).from(element).save();
}
```

## 2025-10-09 (Late Evening): PDF Customization

### Requirements
User requested specific customizations for PDF output:
1. Remove "Manager Report" / "Student Report" badge from top
2. Remove "Report ID" and "Manage Access" footer section
3. Expand all accordions in PDF version

### Implementation

**Added data-attributes for PDF control** (`app/reports/shared/[id]/view/page.tsx`):
```typescript
// Hide badge in PDF
<Flex gap="2" mb="2" align="center" data-pdf-hide>
  <Badge color={report.report_type === 'manager' ? 'blue' : 'green'}>
    {report.report_type === 'manager' ? '📊 Manager Report' : '👤 Student Report'}
  </Badge>
</Flex>

// Hide footer in PDF
<Card data-pdf-hide>
  <Flex justify="between" align="center">
    <Text size="2" color="gray">Report ID: {report.id}</Text>
    {canEdit && <Button>Manage Access</Button>}
  </Flex>
</Card>
```

**Enhanced PDF generator** (`lib/utils/simple-pdf-generator.ts`):

1. **Hide marked elements**:
```typescript
// STEP 5: Hide elements marked with data-pdf-hide
const elementsToHide = clonedDoc.querySelectorAll('[data-pdf-hide]');
elementsToHide.forEach(el => {
  el.style.display = 'none';
});
```

2. **Expand all accordions**:
```typescript
// STEP 6: Expand all accordions
// Change data-state from "closed" to "open"
const dataStateElements = clonedDoc.querySelectorAll('[data-state]');
dataStateElements.forEach(el => {
  if (el.getAttribute('data-state') === 'closed') {
    el.setAttribute('data-state', 'open');
  }
  el.style.display = 'block';
  el.style.height = 'auto';
  el.style.maxHeight = 'none';
  el.style.overflow = 'visible';
});

// Make accordion regions visible
const accordionRegions = clonedDoc.querySelectorAll('[role="region"]');
accordionRegions.forEach(region => {
  region.style.display = 'block';
  region.style.height = 'auto';
  region.style.overflow = 'visible';
});

// Show all hidden elements (except those marked to hide)
const hiddenElements = clonedDoc.querySelectorAll('[style*="display: none"]');
hiddenElements.forEach(hidden => {
  if (!hidden.hasAttribute('data-pdf-hide') && !hidden.closest('[data-pdf-hide]')) {
    hidden.style.display = 'block';
  }
});
```

### Features

✅ **Clean PDF header** - No type badges, just title and description
✅ **No footer clutter** - Report ID and management buttons removed
✅ **All content visible** - Accordions automatically expanded
✅ **Selective hiding** - Uses `data-pdf-hide` attribute for control
✅ **Detailed logging** - Console shows what's being hidden/expanded

### Benefits

- **Professional appearance** - PDF looks clean and focused on content
- **Complete information** - All accordion content visible without interaction
- **Easy maintenance** - Just add `data-pdf-hide` to any element to exclude from PDF
- **Debugging friendly** - Console logs show exactly what's happening

### Files Modified

- `lib/utils/simple-pdf-generator.ts` - Added STEP 5 (hide elements) and STEP 6 (expand accordions)
- `app/reports/shared/[id]/view/page.tsx` - Added `data-pdf-hide` attributes to badge and footer
- `app-creation-log.md` - Updated documentation

## 2025-10-09 (Night): PDF Styling Improvements

### Problem
PDF output was functional but lacked proper styling and spacing:
- No visual separation between sections
- Tables looked plain
- Accordions had no visual distinction
- Overall appearance was too basic compared to web version

### Solution: Enhanced CSS Styles for PDF

**Key Improvements**:

1. **Professional Typography**
   - System fonts: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI'`
   - Proper heading hierarchy (h1: 28px, h2: 22px, h3: 18px, etc.)
   - Better line-height (1.6) for readability
   - Color scheme: `#1a1a1a` for text, `#000` for headings

2. **Card-like Sections**
   ```css
   [class*="Card"], section {
     background: white;
     border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
     border-radius: 8px;
     padding: 16px;
     margin: 16px 0;
     box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
   }
   ```

3. **Enhanced Tables**
   - Better borders: `#d0d0d0`
   - Alternating row colors: `#fafafa`
   - Header styling: `#f5f5f5` background
   - Proper padding: `8px 10px`

4. **Visual Accordion Distinction**
   ```css
   [role="region"] {
     background: #fafafa;
     border-left: 3px solid #0066cc;
     border-radius: 4px;
     padding: 12px;
     margin: 12px 0;
   }
   ```

5. **Canvas/Chart Styling**
   - Border and padding for visual separation
   - Border-radius for modern look
   - Proper margins: `20px 0`

6. **Radix UI Class Support**
   - Preserved class names during cleanup
   - Added selectors for Radix size utilities (`size-1` through `size-8`)
   - Added selectors for spacing utilities (`mb-1` through `mb-5`, `mt-1` through `mt-5`)
   - Added selectors for gap utilities (`gap-1` through `gap-5`)
   - Color utilities (`color-gray`)

7. **Page Break Control**
   - Avoid breaking canvas, tables, and accordions
   - Support for manual page breaks

### Technical Implementation

**STEP 2 Modified**: Preserve class names
```typescript
// Remove inline styles but keep class names for CSS selectors
allElements.forEach(el => {
  if (!isCanvas && !isAccordion) {
    el.removeAttribute('style');
    // Keep class names - commented out: el.removeAttribute('class');
  }
});
```

**STEP 3 Enhanced**: Comprehensive CSS
- 180+ lines of carefully crafted CSS
- Responsive to Radix UI class patterns
- Professional spacing and typography
- Print-optimized colors and borders

### Benefits

✅ **Professional appearance** - Looks similar to web version
✅ **Clear section separation** - Cards with borders and shadows
✅ **Readable tables** - Alternating rows, clear headers
✅ **Visual hierarchy** - Proper heading sizes and spacing
✅ **Accordion distinction** - Blue left border, gray background
✅ **Chart presentation** - Bordered and padded for clarity
✅ **Consistent spacing** - Margins and padding throughout
✅ **Print-friendly** - Optimized colors and page breaks

### Comparison

**Before**: Plain text, no spacing, basic tables
**After**: Professional document with clear structure, visual hierarchy, and proper formatting

### Files Modified

- `lib/utils/simple-pdf-generator.ts` - Enhanced CSS styles, preserved class names
- `app-creation-log.md` - Updated documentation

## 2025-10-09 (Night): Page Break Control

### Problem
PDF generation had poor page break behavior:
- Headings separated from their content (widows)
- Sections split across pages awkwardly
- No control over orphans and widows

### Solution: Advanced Page Break CSS

**Added comprehensive page break rules**:

1. **Heading Protection**
   ```css
   h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
     page-break-after: avoid;
     page-break-inside: avoid;
   }
   ```
   - Prevents headings from appearing alone at bottom of page
   - Keeps heading with its following content

2. **Section Integrity**
   ```css
   canvas, table, [role="region"], [class*="Card"], section {
     page-break-inside: avoid;
   }
   ```
   - Prevents breaking cards/sections in the middle
   - Keeps charts and tables intact
   - Accordion regions stay together

3. **Orphan and Widow Control**
   ```css
   body, p, div, li {
     orphans: 3;
     widows: 3;
   }
   ```
   - `orphans: 3` - minimum 3 lines at bottom of page
   - `widows: 3` - minimum 3 lines at top of page
   - Prevents single lines separated from paragraph

### Technical Details

**Page Break Properties**:
- `page-break-before: avoid` - Don't break before element
- `page-break-after: avoid` - Don't break after element
- `page-break-inside: avoid` - Don't break within element
- `orphans: 3` - Minimum lines at end of page
- `widows: 3` - Minimum lines at start of page

**Applied to**:
- All headings (h1-h6)
- Cards and sections
- Tables and charts
- Accordion regions
- Paragraphs and divs

### Benefits

✅ **No orphaned headings** - Headings stay with content
✅ **Intact sections** - Cards don't split awkwardly
✅ **Better readability** - No single lines separated
✅ **Professional appearance** - Clean page breaks
✅ **Preserved context** - Related content stays together

### Example

**Before**:
```
Page 1:
  ...
  Group Dynamics & Engagement
  
Page 2:
  Students in this cohort exhibited...
```

**After**:
```
Page 1:
  ...
  
Page 2:
  Group Dynamics & Engagement
  Students in this cohort exhibited...
```

### Files Modified

- `lib/utils/simple-pdf-generator.ts` - Added page break control CSS
- `app-creation-log.md` - Updated documentation

## 2025-10-09 (Late Night): Canvas to Image Conversion

### Problem
Despite all page break CSS rules, canvas elements (charts/graphs) were still being split across pages. This is a known limitation of `html2canvas` and PDF generation libraries - they don't reliably respect `page-break-inside: avoid` for canvas elements.

### Solution: Convert Canvas to Images

**Radical approach**: Convert all `<canvas>` elements to `<img>` elements BEFORE PDF generation.

**Why this works**:
- Images are better supported by PDF generators
- `page-break-inside: avoid` works reliably for images
- No canvas rendering issues in PDF
- Better compatibility across browsers

### Implementation

**STEP 5 - Canvas to Image Conversion**:
```typescript
// Find all canvas elements
const canvases = clonedDoc.querySelectorAll('canvas');

canvases.forEach((canvas) => {
  // Convert canvas to data URL
  const dataURL = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
  
  // Create image element
  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.src = dataURL;
  
  // Create protective wrapper
  const wrapper = document.createElement('div');
  wrapper.style.cssText = `
    page-break-inside: avoid !important;
    break-inside: avoid !important;
    margin: 30px 0 !important;
    padding: 20px !important;
    background: white !important;
    border: 1px solid #e0e0e0 !important;
  `;
  
  // Include heading if present
  if (headingToInclude) {
    wrapper.appendChild(headingToInclude);
  }
  
  // Add image to wrapper
  wrapper.appendChild(img);
  
  // Replace canvas with wrapper
  parent.insertBefore(wrapper, canvas);
  parent.removeChild(canvas);
});
```

### Key Features

1. **Canvas → PNG Conversion**
   - Uses `canvas.toDataURL('image/png')`
   - High quality image output
   - Preserves all chart details

2. **Protective Wrapper**
   - Each image wrapped in div with `page-break-inside: avoid`
   - Includes heading if found nearby
   - Styled with border and padding

3. **Heading Association**
   - Searches for h1-h6 before canvas
   - Includes heading in same wrapper
   - Keeps title and chart together

4. **Clean Replacement**
   - Original canvas removed
   - Image inserted in same position
   - No layout shifts

### Benefits

✅ **Reliable page breaks** - Images don't split
✅ **Heading protection** - Title stays with chart
✅ **Better compatibility** - Works across all PDF generators
✅ **High quality** - PNG format preserves details
✅ **Visual consistency** - Same appearance as web version
✅ **No canvas issues** - Eliminates canvas rendering problems

### Technical Details

**Image CSS**:
```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  page-break-inside: avoid;
  break-inside: avoid;
  display: block;
}
```

**Wrapper CSS** (inline):
- `page-break-inside: avoid !important`
- `break-inside: avoid !important`
- `margin: 30px 0`
- `padding: 20px`
- `border: 1px solid #e0e0e0`

### Console Output

```
📊 Found 2 canvas elements - converting to images
📊 Canvas 1: { width: 600, height: 400, hasData: true }
   Included heading "Activity Pattern Distribution..." with canvas 1
   Converted canvas 1 to image and wrapped in protective div
📊 Canvas 2: { width: 600, height: 400, hasData: true }
   Converted canvas 2 to image and wrapped in protective div
```

### Result

**Before**: Canvas elements split across pages
**After**: Charts converted to images, stay intact on single page

### Files Modified

- `lib/utils/simple-pdf-generator.ts` - Added canvas to image conversion in STEP 5
- `app-creation-log.md` - Updated documentation
