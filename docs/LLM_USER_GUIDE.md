# AI Reports - User Guide

## What are AI-Generated Reports?

AI-Generated Reports use artificial intelligence (OpenAI GPT-4) to automatically create comprehensive, easy-to-read summaries of student and team performance. Instead of manually writing reports from raw data, admins can generate professional reports in seconds.

## Two Types of Reports

### 1. Manager Reports
**For**: Program managers, stakeholders, leadership  
**Purpose**: High-level overview of team performance

**Sections**:
1. **Executive Summary**: Quick snapshot of overall performance
2. **Group Dynamics & Engagement**: How the team worked together
3. **Learning Outcomes & Projects**: Quality of work and skills developed
4. **Expert Observations**: What instructors and support team noticed
5. **Opportunities & Recommendations**: What to improve for next time

**Best for**: End-of-program reviews, stakeholder updates, program evaluation

---

### 2. Student Reports
**For**: Individual students  
**Purpose**: Personalized feedback and encouragement

**Sections**:
1. **Your Learning Journey**: Your unique approach and engagement
2. **Your Strengths & Achievements**: What you did well
3. **Your Skills Development**: Technical progress you made
4. **Feedback from Your Instructors**: What your teachers observed
5. **Opportunities for Growth**: Areas to improve (constructive)
6. **Next Steps & Recommendations**: What to do next

**Best for**: Student portfolios, course completion certificates, one-on-one meetings

   - Add specific examples
   - Adjust tone
   - Include context AI doesn't know
   - Fix any inaccuracies
4. Click **"üíæ Save"** to save your edits

üí° **Tip**: AI is smart but not perfect. Always review before publishing!

---

### Step 3: Publish

1. After reviewing and editing
2. Click **"üì§ Publish"**
3. Confirm you want to publish
4. Report becomes visible to intended audience:
   - **Manager reports**: Visible to managers
   - **Student reports**: Visible to that specific student

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Once published, the report is live. Make sure you're happy with it first!

## What Data Does AI Use?

### For Manager Reports:
- Team performance metrics (grades, submissions, engagement)
- Team activity patterns (consistency, effort, collaboration)
- Comments from Program Expert
- Comments from Teaching Assistants
- Comments from Learning Support
- Individual student feedback (if available)

### For Student Reports:
- Individual performance metrics
- Activity timeline and patterns
- Topic-level progress
- Instructor comments about that student
- Comparison to course averages (not shown to student)

---

## Tips for Best Results

### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Fill out team comments** before generating manager reports
- **Add student feedback** before generating student reports
- **Review carefully** - AI can miss context
- **Edit for accuracy** - Add specific examples
- **Use regenerate** if you update comments significantly

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Publish without reviewing
- Regenerate unnecessarily (costs API credits)
- Share draft links (only published reports are meant for sharing)
- Expect AI to know context outside the data

---

## Understanding Report Status

### Draft (Yellow Badge)
- Report is generated but not published
- Only visible to admins
- Can be edited freely
- Students/managers cannot see it

### Published (Green Badge)
- Report is live and visible to audience
- Students/managers can see it
- Can still be edited by admins
- Changes save immediately

### Edited (Blue Badge)
- Admin has made changes after AI generation
- Helps you track which reports you've reviewed

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I edit a published report?
**A**: Yes! Admins can always edit. Changes save immediately.

### Q: How long does generation take?
**A**: Usually 10-30 seconds per report. Batch generation (all students) can take 5-10 minutes for 20 students.

### Q: What if the AI gets something wrong?
**A**: Just edit that section! You have full control over the final content.

### Q: Can I regenerate a report?
**A**: Yes! Click "üîÑ Regenerate" on the edit page. This creates a new draft from current data.

### Q: Will students see all the metrics?
**A**: No. Student reports are written in encouraging, plain language. Technical metrics are translated into friendly feedback.

### Q: How much does this cost?
**A**: ~$0.01-$0.05 per report. A batch of 20 students costs about $0.20-$1.00.

## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" error
‚Üí Make sure you're logged in as an admin

### Generation takes very long
‚Üí Normal for batch jobs. Don't refresh the page!

### Report seems generic
‚Üí Add more team/student comments before generating. AI needs rich data.

### Want different tone/style
‚Üí Just edit the sections! You have full control.

### Need to unpublish
‚Üí Currently not supported. Edit the published report instead.
