# Cogniterra REST API â€” Overview for LLM Integration

The **Cogniterra REST API** provides structured access to educational data such as courses, modules, lessons, and steps.  
It follows REST conventions and uses JSON responses. The API is similar to Stepikâ€™s public API and can be used to retrieve detailed information about course structure and learner progress.

## ðŸ”¹ Authentication

Some endpoints require authentication via API token.  
You can use standard header-based auth:

```
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>
```

## ðŸ”¹ Main Entities

Cogniterra represents course content through a hierarchy:

```
Course â†’ Sections (Modules) â†’ Lessons (Topics) â†’ Steps (Exercises / Materials)
```

### 1. Courses

**Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/courses/{course_id}
```

**Response example:**
```json
{
  "id": 678,
  "title": "AI Engineer Bootcamp",
  "slug": "ai-engineer-bootcamp",
  "summary": "A program for learning to design and deploy LLM-based systems.",
  "language": "en",
  "sections": [1234, 1235, 1236]
}
```

---

### 2. Sections (Modules)

**Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/sections?course={course_id}
```

**Returns:** list of modules belonging to a course.

**Response example:**
```json
{
  "id": 1234,
  "title": "Introduction to LLMs",
  "position": 1,
  "lessons": [1001, 1002, 1003]
}
```

---

### 3. Lessons (Topics)

**Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/lessons/{lesson_id}
```

Each lesson corresponds to a learning topic and contains steps (units of content).

**Response example:**
```json
{
  "id": 1001,
  "title": "Prompt Engineering Basics",
  "steps": [501, 502, 503]
}
```

---

### 4. Steps (Units)

**Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/steps/{step_id}
```

Each step is a piece of interactive content (video, text, quiz, or code exercise).

**Response example:**
```json
{
  "id": 501,
  "step_type": "choice",
  "title": "Choosing better prompts",
  "block": {
    "text": "Which of these prompts produces better reasoning?",
    "options": ["Option A", "Option B"]
  }
}
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Additional Endpoints

### /api/achievements
Returns definitions of user achievements and progress tracking elements.

### /api/achievement-progresses
Tracks user-specific achievement completion status.

### /api/announcements
Lists course-related announcements or instructor messages.

### /api/adaptivity-parameters-changes
Provides analytics about changes in adaptive learning parameters â€” used to measure lesson difficulty and learner skill updates.

## ðŸ”¹ Typical Use Cases

1. **Build course structure visualizations**
   - Combine `/api/sections`, `/api/lessons`, and `/api/steps` responses.
2. **Track learner progress**
   - Use `/api/achievement-progresses` with `user` filters.
3. **Generate summaries for LLM-based tutoring**
   - Combine lesson and step content to produce context-aware explanations.
4. **Integrate course metadata with external dashboards**
   - Extract module names, lesson counts, and assessment statistics.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example: Retrieve full module-topic structure

1. Get sections for a course:
   ```bash
   GET /api/sections?course=678
   ```
2. For each lesson in each section:
   ```bash
   GET /api/lessons/{lesson_id}
   ```
3. Combine responses into:
   ```json
   {
     "module_title": "Working with LangChain",
     "lessons": ["Chains & Agents", "Tool Integration", "Memory Systems"]
   }
   ```

## ðŸ”¹ Notes for LLM usage

When fine-tuning or augmenting prompts with Cogniterra data, itâ€™s recommended to:
- Treat `course`, `section`, and `lesson` names as hierarchical context.
- Use `step_type` to infer whether a given step provides theory or practice.
- Avoid downloading raw user data unless authorized â€” personal identifiers should be excluded.
